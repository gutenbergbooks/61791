<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>

<p>The first draft of this work was presented to the
University of London in December 1921, under the title
of “The Arab Conquest of Transoxania”, as a thesis for
the degree of Master of Arts, and was approved by the
Senate in January 1922, for publication as such. During
the year my attention was taken up in other directions
and, except for the publication of two studies on the
subject in the Bulletin of the School of Oriental Studies,
nothing further was done until by the generosity of the
Trustees of the Forlong Bequest Fund an opportunity
of publication was offered. In its present form the work
has been largely rewritten and revised. It makes no
claim to present a complete historical account of the
Arabs in Central Asia, but is intended solely as a critical
study of the authorities in greater detail than has hitherto
been made. Much is therefore omitted because it has
already been dealt with in the standard histories. In
order to keep down the cost of publication, the extensive
references which originally accompanied the text have
been cut down to a few notes at the end of each chapter.
No references are given when, as in the great majority
of cases, the authority for the statements made can
easily be found in the appropriate place either in <i>T</i>abarī
or Balādhurī.</p>

<p>I regret that several works which are indispensable
for a thorough study of the subject have, for linguistic
reasons, been inaccessible to me. Such are van Vloten’s
<i>Opkomst der Abbasiden</i>, and almost the whole
range of Russian research work. Through the kindness
of Sir Denison Ross, however, I have been able to avail
myself of a draft MS. translation of the most important
and valuable of them all, Professor W. Barthold’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
<i>Turkestan</i>, as well as of his as yet unpublished London
lectures on “The Nomads of Central Asia.” My sincere
thanks are due to Sir Denison Ross also for his continued
interest and material assistance ever since he first introduced
me to the subject; to Sir Thomas Arnold for much
encouragement and helpful counsel; to Professor
Barthold, who has read the MS. through and made a
number of valuable suggestions; to the Trustees of the
Forlong Bequest Fund for their kindness in undertaking
the publication; and in no small measure to my wife,
who has given much time and labour to preparing the
MS. for publication.</p>

<h2 id="I_INTRODUCTION">I. INTRODUCTION<br />
THE OXUS BASIN</h2>

<h3 class="left"><i>Early History.</i></h3>

<p>The Oxus is a boundary of tradition rather than of
history. Lying midway between the old frontier of
Aryan civilisation formed by the Jaxartes and the Pamīr
and the natural strategic frontier offered by the north-eastern
escarpment of the plateau of Īrān, it has never
proved a barrier to imperial armies from either side.
It was not on the Oxus but on the Jaxartes that
Alexander’s strategic insight fixed the position of
Alexander Eschate, and when the outposts of Persian
dominion were thrust back by the constant pressure of
the Central Asian hordes, their retreat was stayed not on
the Oxus but on the Murghāb. Thus when the tide of
conquest turned and the Arabs won back her ancient
heritage for Persia, they, like Alexander, were compelled
to carry their arms ever further to the East and all unknowing
re-establish the frontiers of the Achaemenid
Empire. It was from the legends of Sāsānian times,
enshrined in the pages of the historians and the national
epic of Firdawsī, that the Oxus came to be regarded as
the boundary between Īrān and Tūrān.</p>

<p>Through all the centuries of invasion, however, the
peoples of Sogdiana and the Oxus basin remained Iranian
at bottom, preserving an Iranian speech and Iranian
institutions. But the political conditions of the country
at the period of the Arab conquests were so complex that
it is necessary to trace briefly the course of their
development.</p>

<p>The second century <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> was a period of upheaval in
Central Asia: the powerful Hiung-Nu peoples were
dispossessing weaker tribes of their pasture lands and
forcing them to migrate westwards. Between 150 and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
125 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> a succession of nomadic tribes, the last and
most powerful of which were a branch of the Yueh-Chi,
were driven down into Sogdiana. It is now generally
held that these tribes were of Aryan origin, though the
question is not perhaps settled with absolute certainty.
Before long, however, a second group, the K’ang, possessed
themselves of Sogdiana, driving the Yueh Chi on
into Bactria and the Afghan mountains<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>. In these
districts they found, alongside the Iranian peasantry, a
settled population of Tukhari (in Chinese, Ta-Hia), already
noted in the Chinese annals for their commercial enterprise<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>,
and while at first the nomad tribes introduced
complete confusion, it would seem that they rapidly
absorbed, or were absorbed by, the native elements, and
thus assimilated the Hellenistic civilisation of Bactria.
From this fusion arose, about 50 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>, the powerful
Kushan Empire which spread into India on the one side
and probably maintained some form of suzerainty over
the K’ang kingdoms of Sogdiana on the other. Under
the new empire, Buddhism was acclimatised in Turkestan,
and Sogdiana developed into a great <i>entrepôt</i> for Chinese
trade with the West. Towards the close of the third
century the Kushan Empire, weakened by attacks from
the new national dynasties in India and Persia, reverted
to its primitive form of small independent principalities,
which, however, retained sufficient cohesion to prevent
a Persian reconquest. It is practically certain that
Sāsānian authority never extended beyond Balkh and
rarely as far. In the fourth and fifth centuries references
are made to a fresh horde of nomads in the north-east,
the Juan-Juan (Chionitae, Avars)<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>, but it does not
appear that any new settlements were made in the
Oxus countries.</p>

<p>In the middle of the fifth century, another people,
the Ephthalites (Arabic Hay<i>t</i>al, Chinese Ye-Tha), perhaps
a branch of the Hiung-nu, not only completely
overran the former Kushan territories, but by successive
defeats of the Persian armies forced the Sāsānid Kings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
to pay tribute. The Ephthalites appear to have been a
nomadic people organised as a military caste of the
familiar Turkish type, and the existing institutions and
principalities, in large part at least, continued side by side
with them<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>. Their rule was too transitory to produce
any lasting effects, or to inflict any serious injury on the
commerce and prosperity of Sogdiana.</p>

<p>The rise of the Central Asian empire of the Turks
proper (Tu-Kueh) dates from their overthrow of the Juan-Juan
in Mongolia in 552, under their great Khan, Mokan.
His brother Istämi (the Silzibul of the Byzantine
historians), the semi-independent jabghu of the ten tribes
of Western Turks, after consolidating his power in the
Ili and Chu valleys, formed an alliance with Khusrū
Anūshīrwān, and in a joint attack between 563 and 568
the two powers completely overthrew the Ephthalite
kingdom and divided their territories. For a brief
moment the Oxus was the actual boundary between
Īrān and Tūrān; under pressure from the silk traders
of Sogdiana, however, the alliance was broken and the
weaker successors of Anūshīrwān could scarcely do more
than maintain their outpost garrisons on the Murghāb.
From this time the Ephthalites, like the Kushans, were
gradually assimilating to the Iranian population<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>,
though the change was less rapid in the Cisoxine lands of
Lower <i>T</i>ukhāristān, Bādghīs, and Herāt, where Ephthalite
principalities were re-constituted, probably with Turkish
support, and continued to give Persia much trouble on
her north-eastern frontiers<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>. On the other hand the
Turks of the five western tribes (Nu-she-pi), who became
independent after the break up of the Great Khanate
about 582, maintained their suzerainty over Sogdiana
and the middle Oxus basin by frequent expeditions, in
one case at least as far as Balkh. There is no trace in our
records of extensive Turkish immigration into the
conquered lands; at most, small groups of Turks
wandered south with their herds, especially, it would
seem, south of the Iron Gate<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>. In general, Turkish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
interference in the administration of the subject principalities
was at first limited to the appointment of military
governors and the collection of tribute. Thus, in the
semi-legendary account given by An-Naysābūrī of the
Turkish conquest of Bukhārā the Bukhār Khudāh is
represented as the chief dihqān under the Turkish
governor. It is possible also that the native princes
maintained guards of Turkish mercenaries.</p>

<p>At this period, therefore, so far from the Oxus
being a barrier, there was considerable intercommunication
between the peoples on either side, and at least the
elements of a racial and cultural unity, in spite of political
divisions. This is a factor of importance in the history
of the Arab conquests: the conquest of Transoxania is
intimately linked with the fortunes of Lower <i>T</i>ukhāristān,
and only became possible when the latter country
was completely subdued. On the other hand, the
Jaxartes formed a natural racial and political frontier.
“Shāsh and <i>S</i>ughd have seldom run together” says
Vámbéry, and in spite of nominal annexations on more
than one occasion Muslim rule was not effectively
imposed on Shāsh and Farghāna until some time after
the final conquest of Transoxania. Their chief importance
for the history of Transoxania is that they
formed the jumping-off place for counter-invasions
from the East. It is not without significance that of the
two battles which were decisive in establishing Arab rule
in Sogdiana one was fought to the west of Balkh and the
other on the Talas river, far into the Turkish lands
beyond the Jaxartes (see pp. 84 and 96).</p>

<h3 class="left"><i>Political Divisions.</i></h3>

<p>Researches into Chinese records have now made it
possible to obtain a more definite idea of the political
conditions of these frontier provinces in the seventh
century. All the principalities acknowledged the Khan
of the Western Turks as overlord and paid tribute to
him under compulsion, though, as will appear, there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
good cause for doubting whether a Turkish army ever
came in response to their appeals for support until the
rise of the Türgesh power in 716.</p>

<p>Geographically the cultivated lands to the west and
south-west of the middle Jaxartes are divided by the
Hissar mountains into two well-defined areas. The
northern area includes the rich valley of the Zarafshān
and the lesser streams which descend the northern slope
of the watershed, the southern comprises the broad
basin formed by the Oxus and its tributaries between
the mountains of the Pamīr and the steppelands. The
former, which as a whole is called Sogdiana in distinction
from the smaller principality of <i>S</i>ughd, was at
this period divided between a number of small states,
each independent of the others but forming together a
loose confederacy in a manner strikingly reminiscent of
the Hellenic city-states. The strongest bond of union
was formed by their mutual interest in the Chinese silk
trade, the chief stations of which were at Samarqand,
Paykand, and Kish. The premier city was Samarqand,
the pre-eminence of which and high culture of whose
population is vouched for by Yuan Chwang. Special
emphasis is laid on their enterprise and success in trade,
and a number of early embassies, doubtless commercial
missions, are recorded from Samarqand and Bukhārā
to the Chinese court. The merchant families of Paykand,
according to Tomaschek’s rendering of Narshakhī<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>,
were Kushans, but Iranian elements, reinforced by
emigrants from the Sāsānid dominions, formed the
majority in the cities. The agricultural population was
almost if not entirely Iranian.</p>

<p>A second link between the majority of the cities was
formed by the ruling house of the Shao-wu, if, as the
Chinese records assert, these all belonged to one royal
family. The head of the clan governed Samarqand and
was allied by marriage to the Turkish Khan; cadet
branches ruled in Ushrūsana, Kish, Bukhārā, and the
lesser principalities in the basin of the Zarafshān. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
the later lists the rulers of Shāsh and Farghāna as well as
the Khwārizm Shāh are shown as belonging to the clan
also, though with less probability<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>. Whether the
family were of K’ang origin, or, as the Chinese records
state, belonged to the Yueh-Chi, they appear in the
Arabic histories with Persian territorial titles (Khudāh,
Shāh, and the general term dihqān). Some of the princes
also possessed Turkish titles, probably conferred on them
as vassals of the Khan. The ruler of Samarqand, as
king of <i>S</i>ughd, is called the Ikhshīdh or Ikhshēdh, which
is easily recognised as the Persian <i>khshayathiya</i>. This
title was borne also, as is well known, by the king of
Farghāna. It is certain at least from both Chinese and
Arabic accounts that these rulers were not Turks. The
Turkish names by which they are sometimes called were
given out of deference or compliment to their Turkish
suzerains, just as Arabic names begin to appear amongst
them immediately after the Arab conquests. Particularly
misleading is the name <i>T</i>arkhūn which appears
more than once in the list of princes of Samarqand and
has been erroneously taken as the title Tarkhān, though
it is in reality only the Arabic transcription of a personal
name spelt in the Chinese records Tu-hoen. During
the six or seven hundred years of their rule all these
princes had become fully identified with their Iranian
subjects<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>. The “kingship” moreover was not a
real monarchy but rather the primacy in an oligarchical
system. Their authority was far from absolute, and the
landed aristocracy (dihqāns) and rich merchants possessed,
as will be seen later, not only a large measure of
independence but also on occasion the power to depose
the ruling prince and elect his successor. As the
succession appears to have been largely hereditary it is
probable that, according to Iranian custom, eligibility
was confined to a single royal house. In some cases,
it would seem, the succession was regulated during the
lifetime of the reigning prince by some such method as
association in the principate, probably combined with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
the appointment of the remaining princes to other
fiefs<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>.</p>

<p>The “confederacy” of these states, however, was in
no sense an alliance and probably amounted to little
more than a <i>modus vivendi</i>. Besides the more important
princes there existed an enormous number of petty
autocrats, some possibly Turkish, others probably
descended from former conquerors, whose authority
may sometimes have scarcely extended beyond the
limits of their own villages. In lands subject to the Turks
and patrolled by nomadic tribes an effective centralised
government was hardly possible. Mutual antagonisms
and wars cannot have been uncommon though we have
now no record of them, except that during the early Arab
period there was hostility between Bukhārā and Wardāna,
but the latter cannot be reckoned among the Shao-wu
principalities since, according to Narshakhī, it was
founded by a Sāsānid prince about 300 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> Until the
profitable Chinese trade was threatened by the Arabs
we find no trustworthy record of combined resistance
offered by the country to its piecemeal reduction, and
only long after the conquests of Qutayba is there any
hint of a concerted rising. At the same time, the
strength of the cities and warlike nature of their
inhabitants may be gauged from the way in which they
not only preserved themselves from destruction at the
hands of their successive nomad invaders, but even
gained their respect, while this, in some respects perhaps
the most highly civilised of all the lands subdued by the
Arabs<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>, proved also the most difficult to conquer,
and most intractable to hold.</p>

<p>The same lack of unity is apparent in the districts
south of the Iron Gate, though nominally subject to a
single authority. It is important to bear in mind that
the Zarafshān and Oxus valleys were completely independent
of one another—that the difference between them
was not merely one of government, but also of language,
and even, to some extent, of blood, owing to the greater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
mixture of races in the southern basin. When,
occasionally, as in the “Mūsā legend”, reference is made
in the Arabic histories to common action by <i>S</i>ughd and
<i>T</i>ukhāristān, it is due to a complete misunderstanding
of the state of the country prior to the conquest, and it is
worthy of notice that no such reference is to be found in
any narrative otherwise reliable. On his outward
journey in 630, Yuan Chwang found the country divided
into twenty-seven petty states under separate rulers,
with the chief military authority vested in the Turkish
Shād, the eldest son of the Jabghu of the Western Turks,
who had his seat near the modern Qunduz. During the
period of anarchy which befell the Western Turks in the
following years, the whole district was formed into an
independent kingdom under a son of the former Shād,
who founded the dynasty of Jabghus of <i>T</i>ukhāristān.
Minor Turkish chiefs and intendants probably seized
similar authority in their own districts, and though
the Jabghu was recognised as suzerain of all the lands
from the Iron Gate to Zābulistān and Kapisa and from
Herāt to Khuttal<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>, his authority was little more than
nominal except within his immediate district of Upper
<i>T</i>ukhāristān. The lesser princes, in Shūmān, Khuttal,
&amp;c., many of whom were Turkish, appear to have acted
quite independently and did not hesitate to defy their
Suzerain on occasion. The name <i>T</i>ukhāristān is used
very loosely in the Arabic records, with misleading
effect<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>. How relatively unimportant to the Arabs
<i>T</i>ukhāristān proper was is shown by the fact that its
annexation (see below <a href="#Page_38">p. 38</a>) is passed over in silence.
The brunt of the resistance offered to the early Arab
conquests was borne by the princes of <i>Lower</i> <i>T</i>ukhāristān,
<i>i.e.</i>, the riverain districts south of the Iron Gate,
including Chaghāniān and Balkh, together with the
Ephthalite principalities in Jūzjān, Bādghīs, and Herāt,
and possibly the mountainous fringe of Gharjistān.
This explains why the Arabs always regarded Balkh,
the old religious capital of the Kushan Empire and site<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
of the famous Buddhist shrine of Nawbahār, as the
capital of the “Turks”; it was in fact the centre of what
we might almost term the “amphictyony” of Lower
<i>T</i>ukhāristān, combining strategic and commercial
importance with religious veneration. Long after the
Nawbahār had been destroyed by Ibn ʿĀmir this sentiment
continued to exist in the country<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>.</p>

<p>A chance narrative in <i>T</i>abarī (II. 1224 f.), which,
though of Bāhilite origin, can scarcely have been invented,
indicates the situation in Lower <i>T</i>ukhāristān in 710.
In the presence of Qutayba, the Shād and as-Sabal
(King of Khuttal) do homage to the Jabghu, the former
excusing himself on the ground that though he has joined
Qutayba against the Jabghu, yet he is the Jabghu’s
vassal. The Ephthalite prince of Bādghīs then does
homage to the Shād, who must consequently be regarded
as the chief prince in Lower <i>T</i>ukhāristān. His identification
with the Jabghu himself in another passage
(<i>T</i>ab. II. 1206. 9) is obviously impossible. Though
certainty on the point is hardly to be expected, the
description best suits the king of Chaghāniān (Chāghān
Khudāh), who consistently adopted an attitude of co-operation
with the Arabs. It would seem too that the
king of Chaghāniān commanded the armies of Lower
<i>T</i>ukhāristān in 652 and again in 737. Moreover, an
embassy to China on behalf of <i>T</i>ukhāristān in 719 was
actually despatched by the king of Chaghāniān, which
implies that he held a status in the kingdom consonant
with the high title of Shād. The conclusion drawn by
Marquart and Chavannes that the king of Chaghāniān
and the Jabghu were identical is disproved by the
Chinese records<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>.</p>

<p>Such conditions of political disunion were naturally
all in favour of the Arabs. It might have seemed also
that the general insecurity, together with the burden
of maintaining armies and courts and the ever-recurring
ravages of invasion, would move the mass of the population
to welcome the prospect of a strong and united<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
government, more especially as so large a proportion of
the Muslim armies were composed of their Persian kin.
For the Arabic records in general are misleading on two
important points. By their use of the word “Turk”
for all the non-Persian peoples of the East, they give the
impression (due perhaps to the circumstances of the time
in which the chief histories were composed) that the
opponents of the Arabs in Transoxania were the historical
Turks. The truth is that until 720 the Arab invaders
were resisted only by the local princes with armies
composed almost entirely of Iranians, except perhaps
on one or two special occasions when Turkish forces may
have intervened. The other error is in interpreting the
conquests as primarily wars for the Faith. Rebellion,
for instance, is expressed in terms of apostasy. It is now
well established that this conception is exaggerated;
religious questions did not, in fact, enter until much
later and even then chiefly as expressions of political
relationships. To the Iranian peasantry, themselves
steadfastly attached to the national cults, the advent of
another faith in this meeting-place of all the cultures
and religions of Asia at first carried little significance.
Two factors in particular combined to provoke a resistance
so stubborn that it took the Arabs a century
merely to reduce the country to sullen submission. The
first of these was the proud national spirit of the
Iranians which was eventually to break down the
supremacy of the Arabs and give birth to the first
Persian dynasties in Islām. The few wise governors of
Khurāsān found in this their strongest support, but,
outraged again and again by an arrogant and rapacious
administration, the subject peoples became embittered
and sought all means of escape from its tyranny. The
second was the interest of the commercial relations on
which the wealth and prosperity of the country depended.
This again might have disposed the cities to
accept a rule which promised not only stability, but a
wide extension of opportunity. The Arab governors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
as we shall see, were not indeed blind to this, but the
exactions of the treasury, and still more the greed of local
officials, combined with the unsettlement of constant
invasion to create an attitude of distrust, which deepened
later into despair. It must not be forgotten that the
commercial ties of the Sogdians were much stronger with
the East than with the West, and that this too prompted
them to cultivate relations with the Turks and Chinese
rather than with the Arabs when the necessity of making
a choice was forced upon them.</p>

<h3 class="left"><i>The Arabic Sources.</i></h3>

<p>The early Arabic sources are remarkably rich in
material for the reconstruction of the conquests in
Khurāsān and Transoxania. For the earlier period the
narratives of Yaʿqūbī and Balādhurī are nearly as full
as those of <i>T</i>abarī, but the special value of the latter lies
in his method of compilation which renders the traditions
amenable to critical study and thus provides a control
for all the others. Moreover, while the other historians,
regarding the conquests of Qutayba as definitely completing
the reduction of Transoxania, provide only meagre
notices for the later period, <i>T</i>abarī more than compensates
for their silence by the enormous wealth of detail
embodied in the accounts he quotes from Al-Madāʾinī
and others of the last thirty years of Umayyad rule.
As a general rule, these three historians rely on different
authorities, though all use the earlier histories of Al-Madāʾinī
and Abū ʿUbayda to some extent. The monograph
of Narshakhī (d. 959 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>) based on both Arabic
and local sources, with some resemblance to Balādhurī,
is unfortunately preserved only in a Persian version of
two centuries later which has obviously been edited, to
what extent is unknown, but which probably represents
the original as unsatisfactorily as Balʿamī’s Persian
version of <i>T</i>abarī. Even so it preserves to us some
account of the peoples against whom the Arab invaders
were matched, and thus does a little to remedy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
the defects of the other historians in this respect. It
may well be doubted, however, whether some of its
narratives merit the reliance placed upon them by van
Vloten<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>. The much later historian Ibn al-Athīr introduces
very little new material, but confines himself for
the most part to abridging and re-editing the narratives
in <i>T</i>abarī, with a tendency to follow the more exaggerated
accounts. The geographer Ibn Khūrdādhbih gives a
list of titles and names, which is, however, too confused
to supply any reliable evidence.</p>

<p>Reference has already been made to certain aspects of
the conquests in which the Arab historians are misleading.
Their information on the Turks and the principalities of
Sogdiana can now, fortunately, be supplemented and parts
of their narratives controlled from Chinese sources,
chiefly through Chavannes’ valuable “Documents sur
les Tou-Kiue (Turcs) Occidentaux.” But there are two
other facts which also demand attention: one, that the
Arabic authorities, as we possess them, and even with all
allowance made for their limitations, are by no means
exhaustive; <i>i.e.</i>, reliance on omissions in the narratives
is an unsafe principle of criticism: the other, that by
critical study it is possible to distinguish at certain points
several lines of tendentious tradition or legend, directed
to the interests of national feeling or of some particular
tribe or faction, and centred in some cases round
specific persons. These may most conveniently be
summarised as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1. A Qaysite tradition, centred on the family of
Ibn Khāzim:</p>

<p>2. An Azd-Rabīʿa tradition, centred on Muhallab
and hostile to <i>H</i>ajjāj. This became the most
popular tradition among the Arabs, and is
followed by Balādhurī, but opposed by Yaʿqūbī:</p>

<p>3. A Bāhilite tradition, centred on the tribal hero,
Qutayba b. Muslim. In general it found little
favour but is occasionally quoted somewhat
sarcastically by <i>T</i>abarī.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>4. A local Bukhārā tradition, followed by Yaʿqūbī,
Balādhurī and Narshakhī. It presents the
early conquests under the form of an historical
romance, centred on the Queen Khātūn in the
part of a national Boadicea. Other local
traditions, which are frequently utilised by
<i>T</i>abarī, seem to be much more free from serious
exaggeration:</p>

<p>5. The few notices in Dīnawarī follow an entirely
divergent and extremely garbled tradition from
unknown sources, which may for the most
part be neglected:</p>

<p>6. The quotations made by Balādhurī (<i>e.g.</i> 422. 10)
from Abū ʿUbayda show the influence of a rewriting
of episodes with an anti-Arab bias,
directed to the interests of the Shuʿūbīya movement,
in which Abū ʿUbayda was a prominent
figure<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>.</p>

<p>7. In the later period, there appears also the fragments
of a tradition of which Nasr b. Sayyār is
the hero.</p>

</div>

<p>Some, if not all, of these traditions developed in some
detail, and where they are not balanced by other versions
they present a distorted narrative of events, verging in
some cases on the fictitious. The most noteworthy
examples of this are the Khātūn legend (see below <a href="#Page_18">p. 18</a>)
and the typical story of the exploits of Mūsā b. Khāzim
in Transoxania in a style not unworthy of Bedouin
romance<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>. It is therefore most important to disentangle
these variant traditions and assign its proper
value to each. The Bāhilite accounts of Qutayba’s
conquests, for instance, contain wild exaggerations of
fact, which, nevertheless, have sometimes been utilised
in all seriousness by modern historians, amongst other
purposes to establish synchronisms with the Turkish
inscriptions<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>.</p>

<p>With these precautions, it is possible to follow up and
reconstruct, with comparative certainty and completeness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
that progress of the Arab arms in Central Asia whose
vicissitudes are outlined in the following pages.</p>

<h2 id="II_THE_EARLY_RAIDS">II. THE EARLY RAIDS</h2>

<h3 class="left"><i>The Conquest of Lower <span class="antiqua">T</span>ukhāristān.</i></h3>

<p>Arab legend relates that the Muslim forces, pursuing
Yazdigird from the field of Nihāwand in 21/642, had
already come in contact with the “Turks” of <i>T</i>ukhāristān
before the death of ʿOmar. But the final
destruction of the Sāsānid power and first imposition of
Arab rule on Khurāsān only followed ten years later, by
the troops of ʿAbdullah ibn ʿĀmir, ʿOthmān’s governor
in Ba<i>s</i>ra. The Ephthalites of Herāt and Bādghīs submitted
without a blow, and the first serious check to
their advance was met in the Murghāb valley, when al-A<i>h</i>naf
b. Qays with an army of 4,000 Arabs and 1,000
Persians found himself opposed by the organised forces
of Lower <i>T</i>ukhāristān and was compelled to retire on
Merv-Rūdh. A second expedition under al-Aqraʿ b.
<i>H</i>ābis, however, defeated a weaker force in Jūzjān, and
subsequently occupied Jūzjān, Fāryāb, <i>T</i>ālaqān, and
Balkh. Small divisions made plundering raids into the
neighbouring territories, <i>e.g.</i>, to Siminjān (a town within
the frontiers of <i>T</i>ukhāristān proper, governed by a
Turkish prince, the Ruʿb Khān), and to Khwārizm, not
always with success; on the other hand, a successful
raid was made on Māyamurgh in Sogdiana in 33/654,
which is mentioned by Abū ʿUbayda alone of the Arabic
authorities<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>. A general insurrection which broke
out shortly afterwards, headed by a certain Qārin,
apparently a member of the noble Persian family bearing
that name, seems to have been instrumental in causing
the Arabs to evacuate Khurāsān for a time<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>, though
several raids are recorded of ʿAlī’s governors between
35 and 38 <span class="smcapuc">A.H.</span> These earliest “conquests,” in fact, were
little more than plundering raids on a large scale, the
effect of that movement of expansion whose momentum
was carrying forward the Arabs irresistibly. According<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
to the Chinese records, which, however, require to be
used with caution at this point, the retreat of the Arabs
in 655 was followed up by the army of <i>T</i>ukhāristān who
reinstated Pērōz, the son of Yazdigird, as titular king of
Persia<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>.</p>

<p>When peace was restored to Islām by the recognition
of Muʿāwiya in 41/661, Ibn ʿĀmir was again entrusted
with the conquest of Khurāsān. The same rough and
ready methods were adopted as before; there appears
to have been no definite plan of invasion, and even the
order of governors is uncertain. Not only are traditions
relating to <span class="smcapuc">A.H.</span> 32 and 42 confused by the different
authorities, but a vast amount of the whole is affected
by tribal legends. Hints of fierce resistance are given
from time to time. Qays b. al-Haytham, the governor’s
first legate, was faced with a fresh revolt in Bādghīs,
Herāt, and Balkh. He recaptured the latter and in retaliation
destroyed the famous shrine of Nawbahār, but
left the Ephthalites to be dealt with by his successor,
ʿAbdullah ibn Khāzim. It is clear that there was no
ordered progress of the Arab arms until Khurāsān was
brought under the administration of Ziyād b. Abīhi.
After an experimental division of the province under
tribal leaders, a policy obviously dangerous and quickly
abandoned, Ziyād, realising the danger of allowing
Persian nationalism a free hand in the East, backed up
by the resources of <i>T</i>ukhāristān, centralised the administration
at Merv, and organised a preventive campaign.
In 47/667 his lieutenant, al-<i>H</i>akam b. ʿAmr al-Ghifārī,
opened a series of campaigns directed to the conquest
of Lower <i>T</i>ukhāristān and Gharjistān, in the course of
which he crossed the Oxus and carried his arms into
Chaghāniān, and drove Pērōz back to China in discomfiture.
On his death, three years later, the conquered
provinces rose in revolt, but the new governor, Rabīʿ
b. Ziyād al-<i>H</i>ārithī, the first conqueror of Sijistān,
after reducing Balkh, pursued the Ephthalite army into
Quhistān and dispersed it with great slaughter. Again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
an expedition was sent across the Oxus into Chaghāniān
(clearly indicating the connection between Chaghāniān
and Lower <i>T</i>ukhāristān), while another directed down the
left bank of the river secured Zamm and Āmul, the two
chief ferry points for Sogdiana. Mention is also made of
a conquest of Khwārizm. All these expeditions seem
to point to a methodical plan of conquest, arranged
between Ziyād and his governors; the Arab power was
thus firmly established, for the moment at least, in the
Cisoxanian lands, and the way prepared for the invasion
of Sogdiana. A further important step was the colonisation
of Khurāsān by fifty thousand families from Ba<i>s</i>ra
and Kūfa<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>, settled according to Arab practice in five
garrison towns, for the double purpose of securing the
conquests already made, and providing the forces for their
further extension.</p>

<h3 class="left"><i>The First Invasion of Bukhārā and <span class="antiqua">S</span>ughd.</i></h3>

<p>Although at this junction Ziyād himself died, his
policy was carried on by his sons, in particular by
ʿUbaydullah. Scarcely any governor, not even <i>H</i>ajjāj,
has suffered so much at the hands of the traditionists as
the “Murderer of <i>H</i>usayn,” though his ability and
devotion to the Umayyads are beyond question. It is not
surprising therefore that his earlier military successes
should be so briefly related, in spite of their importance.
Yet as he was no more than 25 years of age when
appointed by Muʿāwiya to the province of Khurāsān on
probation, and only two years later was selected to fill
his father’s position in ʿIrāq, his administration must have
been markedly successful. The policy of Ziyād had now
firmly secured Khurāsān and made it feasible to use it as
a base for the extension of the conquests into the rich
lands across the river. On his arrival at Merv, therefore,
in the autumn of 53/673, the new governor began preparations
for an invasion of Bukhārā.</p>

<p>The Shao-wu principality of Bukhārā was at this time
second in importance only to Samarqand. It included<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
not only the greater part of the oasis (“al-Bukhārīya”)
then much more thickly populated than now, but also the
great emporium of Paykand, which controlled the trade
route across the Oxus at Āmul. Of its early history we
have two accounts, both confused, inaccurate in detail,
and often conflicting. From these it may be gathered
that the prince, who held the high Turkish title of Shād<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>,
resided at Paykand, the citadel of Bukhārā being either
founded or restored by the Bukhār Khudāh Bidūn, probably
in consequence of the Arab invasions. This prince at his
death left a son only a few months old on whose behalf
the regency was exercised by the Queen-Mother. This
princess, known under the title of Khātūn (a Turkish
form of the Sogdian word for “lady”) became the central
figure in the local traditions, which represent the Arab
invasions as occurring precisely during the period of her
regency. This version is the one accepted by Balādhurī,
Yaʿqūbī, and Narshakhī, but though not altogether
devoid of historical value, it is certainly misplaced, and
the true account of the early conquests must, for cogent
reasons, be sought in the brief and widely divergent
narratives of <i>T</i>abarī. In the first place the Khātūn-legend,
like all such legends, has grown by natural
elaboration of detail, as in the account given by Narshakhī
of Khātūn’s administration of justice and by continual
accretions from other streams of tradition, as seen, on
comparing the narratives of Balādhurī and Narshakhī,
in the introduction of episodes of Ibn Khāzim and Muhallab.
Critical examination also reveals alternative
traditions and chronological inconsistencies, as, for
example, the birth of <i>T</i>ughshāda after the invasion of
Saʿīd b. ʿOthmān, Khātūn’s reign of 15 years, and others
mentioned below. There is clear evidence of the late
compilation of the tradition in the frequent references to
“<i>T</i>arkhūn, King of <i>S</i>ughd,” though his reign did not begin
until considerably after 696<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>. It may be noticed that
in the variant account of the conquests prefixed to the
Persian edition of Narshakhī and ascribed to An-Naysābūrī<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
there is no reference at all to Khātūn. Moreover
there are indications that <i>T</i>abarī was aware of the
local tradition and completely rejected it; this, at least,
would account for the unusual practice of specifying
Qabaj-Khātūn as “the wife of the king” in 54 <span class="smcapuc">A.H.</span>
Even Balādhurī rejects the more fantastic developments
of the legend. <i>T</i>abarī’s narratives, however, require to
be collated with the additional material in Balādhurī,
who has not relied entirely on the local tradition. The germ
of the native version is probably to be found in a confusion
of the Arab conquests with the later war between
Bukhārā and Wardāna<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>, whose echoes are heard in
Qutayba’s invasions thirty years after.</p>

<p>In the spring of 54/674 ʿUbaydullah b. Ziyād crossed
the river and marched directly on Paykand. After a
partial success, he led his forces forward towards Bukhārā
and severely defeated the army of the Bukhār Khudāh.
From <i>T</i>abarī’s narrative, which relates only that two
thousand men of Bukhārā, skilful archers, were taken by
ʿUbaydullah to Ba<i>s</i>ra, where they formed his personal
guard, it is left to be inferred that a treaty was concluded
under which the Bukhār Khudāh became tributary. The
local tradition magnifies the expedition by adding a siege
of Bukhārā (during the winter) and bringing in an army
of Turks to assist Khātūn, but confirms the success of
the Arabs. ʿUbaydullah’s practice on this occasion of
forming a bodyguard or retinue of captives appears to
have been a common one. ʿAbdur-Ra<i>h</i>mān ibn Samura
had previously brought captives from Sijistān to Ba<i>s</i>ra,
where they built him a mosque, and later governors of
Khurāsān continued the practice, as will be seen. In
this may be recognised perhaps the germ of the Turkish
guards recruited by the later ʿAbbāsid Caliphs.</p>

<p>ʿUbaydullah’s successor, Aslam b. Zurʿa, remained
inactive, but in 56/676 Saʿīd b. ʿOthmān, who had obtained
the governorship of Khurāsān by importuning
Muʿāwiya, carried the Arab arms more deeply into Transoxania,
defeated the <i>S</i>ughdians in the open field and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
reduced their city. Taking fifty young nobles as hostages,
he retired from <i>S</i>ughd and subsequently occupied
Tirmidh, an important fortress on the Oxus controlling
the main North and South trade route, having presumably
marched through the Iron Gate. The conquest
of <i>S</i>ughd was thus definitely co-ordinated with that of
Chaghāniān. <i>T</i>abarī’s narrative is strangely vague and
abrupt; it contains no mention of Bukhārā nor any
definite reference to Samarqand, except for the statement
that it was the objective of Saʿīd’s expedition. Using
this narrative alone, one would be inclined to suspect
that the city captured by Saʿīd was not Samarqand but
Kish (since it has been established by Marquart that
Kish was formerly called <i>S</i>ughd), and that the reference
to Samarqand was due to a later misunderstanding of
the name<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>. On the other hand, both the local
tradition and Abū ʿUbayda speak of a siege of Samarqand
by Saʿīd, though their narratives are far from being in
agreement in detail, and there are other indications of
confusion between Saʿīd and Salm b. Ziyād. All accounts
except Narshakhī’s, however, agree that the hostages
who were carried by Saʿīd to Madīna and there murdered
him were <i>S</i>ughdians<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>. Balādhurī’s tradition of Saʿīd’s
expedition is as follows. On his crossing the river,
Khātūn at first renewed her allegiance, only to withdraw
it again on the approach of an army of Turks, <i>S</i>ughdians,
and men of Kish and Nasaf, 120,000 strong. Saʿīd,
however, completely defeated the enemy and after a
triumphal entry into Bukhārā, marched on Samarqand,
his forces swelled by Khātūn’s army, besieged it for three
days and made it tributary. On his return he captured
Tirmidh and while there received the tribute due from
Khātūn and the allegiance of Khuttal. Narshakhī’s
account is the same in essentials, adding only a number of
imaginative details.</p>

<p>Saʿīd was unable to retain his position in Khurāsān,
and for five years the conquests were stayed (except for
summer raids) under the indolent Aslam b. Zurʿa and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
avaricious ʿAbdur-Ra<i>h</i>mān b. Ziyād. In 61/680-681
Yazīd I appointed Salm, another son of Ziyād, to
Khurāsān and Sijistān. Eager to emulate his brother,
Salm, even before leaving Ba<i>s</i>ra, announced his intention
of renewing the expeditions into Transoxania and enlisted
a picked force on the spot, including such tried leaders as
Muhallab b. Abī <i>S</i>ufra and ʿAbdullah b. Khāzim. From a
poem preserved in the <i>H</i>amāsa of Abū Tammām<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
it would appear that somewhat unwilling levies for this
expedition were raised even in Mesopotamia. Towards
the close of the winter a surprise attack was made on
Khwārizm, with some success. <i>T</i>abarī gives two versions
of this expedition, the first of which is a highly embroidered
one from the Muhallabite tradition. During the
same year, Salm marched into <i>S</i>ughd and occupied
Samarqand, where he appears to have made his headquarters
over the winter. Balādhurī mentions a subsidiary
raid on Khujanda under Aʿshā Hamdān, in which,
however, the Muslims were defeated, and a <i>S</i>ughdian
revolt which was crushed with the loss of its leader, here
called Bandūn. The name is almost certainly to be read
as that of the Bukhār-Khudāh, Bīdūn<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>, and in view
of the silence of <i>T</i>abarī raises rather a difficult problem.
It may be conjectured that what Balādhurī intended was
a revolt of the Bukhariots, combined with <i>S</i>ughdian
forces. The origin of this statement may perhaps be
sought for in the Bukhārā tradition, which Balādhurī
does not follow in his general account of the expeditions
of Salm, but which he may have tried to work in with the
other. On the other hand he nowhere refers to Bīdūn
as the Bukhār Khudāh. As related by Narshakhī and
Yaʿqūbī Salm’s expedition is directed solely against
Bukhārā. Khātūn, on promising her hand to <i>T</i>arkhūn,
receives a reinforcement of 120,000 men from <i>S</i>ughd, and
Bīdūn (here still alive) recruits an army in “Turkistān,”
including the “Prince of Khotan.” After severe fighting,
the Muslim forces, numbering 6,000, kill Bīdūn and rout
the unbelievers, taking so much booty that the share of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
each horseman amounts to 2,400 dirhems. Khātūn,
thoroughly humbled by this decisive proof of Arab
invincibility, sues for peace and pays a heavy tribute.
Beyond the fantastic exaggerations and incoherencies of
the legend, there is nothing inherently improbable in a
Bukhariot revolt. In support of this view, it may be
remarked that the death of Bīdūn at this point would
agree with the slender data we have for the internal wars
which probably formed the original basis of the Khātūn-legend,
and would also provide a foothold for the later
developments of the tradition. Without fuller evidence,
however, we can get no further than reasonable
conjecture.</p>

<p>After the conquests made by Salm, which probably
occupied the years 682 and 683, it seemed as though the
Arabs were on the verge of imposing their rule on
Transoxania when civil war broke out in the heart of the
Empire. Even allowing for the fact that these expeditions
were little more than raids, the comparative ease
with which the Arabs held to ransom the richest cities
in the country is astonishing. The explanation can lie
only in their mutual exclusiveness. There is not a hint
of united action in the field in <i>T</i>abarī’s accounts<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>.
A factor which may have exercised some influence was
that Sogdiana was completely isolated during these years
and unable to look for support from without. The
power of the Western Turks was broken by the Chinese
armies between 645 and 658; Chinese forces are said to
have reached as far west as Kish, and the Emperor Kao-Tsung
had officially annexed all the territories formerly
included in the Turkish dominions. In the latter year
the provinces of Sogdiana and the Jaxartes were organized
in sixteen districts, including a “Government of Persia”
under the Pērōz already mentioned, situated apparently
in Sijistān, possibly even in Eastern Khurāsān<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>.
The immediate practical effect of this change of status
was of little moment, but her nominal annexation gave
China a prestige which was destined to exercise immense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
influence in determining the attitude of the peoples of
Sogdiana to the Arabs. From 670 to 692, however, the
new power of Tibet held the Chinese armies in check in
the Tarim basin and cut off all possibility of Chinese
intervention in the West. The Sogdian princes were
thus thrown on their own resources, and, ignorant as
yet of the danger behind the Arab raids, they seem to have
bowed to the storm. It must not be forgotten that the
cities had never before met such an enemy as the Arabs.
They had been accustomed to plundering raids by Turks,
who disappeared as quickly as they came, and who,
disliking to undertake a lengthy siege, were easily
appeased by a ransom. Familiar with such nominal
annexations, they would naturally adopt the same tactics
against the new invaders. Had the Arabs maintained
their pressure, there was thus every prospect that Transoxania
would have been colonised with a tithe of the
expense and loss incurred in its reconquest and would
have become as integral a part of the Muslim dominions
as Khurāsān. But the opportunity was lost in the
fratricidal struggles of the factions, and when the Arabs
recommenced their encroachments, the determined
resistance offered to their advance showed that the lessons
of the first invasion had not been lost on the native
princes.</p>

<h3 class="left"><i>The Withdrawal of the Arabs.</i></h3>

<p>The tribal feuds which occupied the Arabs of Khurāsān
left the princes of Transoxania free to regain their independence.
It would seem even that Lower <i>T</i>ukhāristān
was not only in part lost to the Arabs but that local
forces took the offensive and raided Khurāsān. On the
gradual restoration of order under Umayya, however,
Lower <i>T</i>ukhāristān again recognised, at least in name,
the Arab suzerainty<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>. Meanwhile, a strange episode
had occurred in Chaghāniān. Mūsā, the son of ʿAbdullah
ibn Khāzim, sent by his father to secure a safe place of
retreat, had captured the strong fortress of Tirmidh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
from which he continually raided the neighbouring
districts. His exploits were worked up in popular story
into an epic of adventure, in which legend has almost
overlaid historical fact. The most fantastic exaggerations
were devised in order to provide a suitable background
for the incredible deeds of valour indulged in
by the hero. But in truth his actual exploits were
sufficiently amazing, and all the efforts of the forces of
the local rulers (magnified in the legend to huge armies of
“Turks and Hay<i>t</i>al and Tibetans”), although aided
on one occasion by a force of Khuzāʿites, were unable to
dislodge him. For fifteen years he remained in secure
possession of his stronghold, a refuge for the disaffected
from all sides, and a standing example of the helplessness
of the rulers across the river.</p>

<p>In 77/696 Umayya re-opened the campaigns into
Transoxania. An expedition to Khwārizm was successful<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>,
another across the Oxus narrowly escaped destruction.
Balādhurī mentions, with doubtful accuracy, a
successful raid on Khuttal, which may, however, only be a
variant on this. An expedition directed against Bukhārā,
which is said to have had Tirmidh as a second objective,
was hurriedly abandoned on the fresh outbreak of revolt
under Bukayr b. Wishā<i>h</i> in Khurāsān. Though the
revolt failed in its immediate object, a most serious
situation had been created. Bukayr had endeavoured
to rally the Persians to his side by promising all converts
remission of Kharāj. The opportunity was undoubtedly
seized by large numbers, and the pacification occasioned
some negotiations between Umayya and Thābit b. Qu<i>t</i>ba,
an influential noble who acted as spokesman for the
mawālī of Eastern Khurāsān. Umayya’s reimposition of
Kharāj, however, caused widespread unrest<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> and made
prompt action necessary. ʿAbdul-Malik at once recalled
his hapless kinsman (in 78) and made Khurāsān a dependency
of ʿIrāq under the government of <i>H</i>ajjāj. This
far-sighted governor had already dealt with a desperate
situation of the same sort in ʿIrāq and reduced it to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
outward tranquillity. The same extreme measures that
had been adopted there were not necessary in Khurāsān;
its troubles were due less to insurgent mawālī than to the
factions of Qays. <i>H</i>ajjāj was himself a strong Qaysite,
but he was not the man to put party before the interests
of the State. The first necessity was to appoint a
governor who could be trusted to repress both forms of
anarchy and in Muhallab such a man was available. His
tribe of Azd was not yet strong enough in Khurāsān to
cause the risk of opening a new channel for factional
strife, and his military reputation fitted him for carrying
out <i>H</i>ajjāj’s policy of active campaigning as an antidote
to internal dissension. It is possible that <i>H</i>ajjāj had in
mind from the first a definite conquest of Transoxania,
but for a few years nothing more than sporadic raids took
place.</p>

<p>Muhallab’s first care, however, was to encourage the
settlement of Azd in Khurāsān, until he was supported
by a division equal in size to any other. After securing
the crossing at Zamm in 80/699 he marched into the
district of Kish and there established his headquarters
for two years, besieging the city and sending out minor
expeditions under his sons in various directions<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>.
Yazīd was sent with a force into Khuttal, nominally to
co-operate with a pretender to the throne, but met with
little success; <i>H</i>abīb, sent against Rabinjān, found himself
countered by the forces of Bukhārā. Balādhurī’s
account of Muhallab’s campaigns is ludicrously exaggerated;
<i>T</i>abarī quotes Muhallab himself as discouraging
any attempts at effecting a conquest. On the death of
his son al-Mughīra in Rajab 82, he came to terms with
Kish and abandoned his expeditions, but died in the
following Dhuʾl-<i>H</i>ijja (Jan. 702) near Merv Rūdh, and
was succeeded by his son Yazīd.</p>

<p>The Muhallabite tradition which represents the
appointment as distasteful to <i>H</i>ajjāj but popular in
Khurāsān is almost certainly influenced by the later
hostility between Yazīd and <i>H</i>ajjāj. It is probable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
however, that <i>H</i>ajjāj, whose policy was to keep his
governors dependent on himself, viewed with suspicion
the concentration of authority in the hands of the leader
of a powerful hostile clan, but he was content to wait for
the meantime and give Yazīd sufficient rope to hang himself.
Except for an attempted raid on Khwārizm
Yazīd carried out no expeditions, while under his government
the precarious internal balance of Khurāsān was
soon upset. The quarrels of Qays had been composed by
Muhallab, but they were in no mood to bear with the
leadership of the parvenu Azd; already before the
death of Muhallab, in spite of the Tamīmite eulogy
quoted by <i>T</i>abarī, there was a moment when the feud
threatened to break out. The pronounced factional
leanings of Yazīd strained the situation still further.
Even more serious was the attitude of the mawālī.
<i>H</i>urayth, the brother of Thābit ibn Qu<i>t</i>ba, had been left
behind at Kish by Muhallab to collect the tribute, but on
his return was scourged for disobedience. The disgrace
cut <i>H</i>urayth deeply; too late Muhallab realised the
gravity of his act, but <i>H</i>urayth spurned his overtures
and with Thābit fled to Mūsā at Tirmidh. Yazīd retaliated
with foolish severity by maltreating their families,
which only inflamed the general resentment. <i>H</i>urayth
and Thābit used their influence to stir up an insurrection
to act in concert with Mūsā; the king of Chaghāniān
and his Ephthalite confederates headed by Nēzak, prince
of Bādghīs, readily responded, while Persian interest was
excited by the return to <i>T</i>ukhāristān of the son of Pērōz,
the heir of the Sāsānids. It seems probable that even some
of Qays were a party to the scheme<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>. Seizing an
opportunity when Yazīd was occupied with the rebel
forces of Ibn al-Ashath on the borders of Khurāsān the
revolt broke out. Yazīd was powerless to prevent the
expulsion of his residents from Chaghāniān and Lower
<i>T</i>ukhāristān, and Mūsā is said to have refrained from
invading Khurāsān only from fear that it would fall into
the hands of Thābit and <i>H</i>urayth. Even the success<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
claimed for Yazīd in Bādghīs can have been of little effect<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>.
Fortunately for the Arabs, Mūsā’s jealousy of
Thābit and <i>H</i>urayth caused a division in the ranks of
their enemies, but though the brothers both fell in battle,
the danger remained acute. The son of Pērōz still
lingered in <i>T</i>ukhāristān, and even at Damascus there
was some uneasiness about the situation in Khurāsān<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>.</p>

<p>To <i>H</i>ajjāj it was obvious that the first essential was
to reunite the Arabs and that so long as Yazīd was in
power that was impossible. The only difficulty was to
find a governor acceptable to Qays and to substitute him
without risking a revolt of Azd. It was solved with
admirable ingenuity. By ordering Yazīd to transfer
his authority to his weaker brother Mufa<i>dd</i>al, <i>H</i>ajjāj
at one stroke removed the man from whom he had most
to fear and prevented him from uniting Azd in opposition,
although Yazīd realised that the fall of his house was
imminent. At the same time the Caliph’s permission
was sought for the nomination of Qutayba ibn Muslim
as governor of Khurāsān. Belonging to the neutral tribe
of Bāhila, Qutayba was reckoned as allied to Qays,
but might be trusted to hold the scales evenly between
the factions; he had already distinguished himself in
ʿIrāq and in his governorship of Rayy, and was the more
devoted to <i>H</i>ajjāj in that he was protected by no strong
party of his own. The accepted belief that <i>H</i>ajjāj took
no steps to remove the family of Muhallab until Mūsā was
put out of the way is based on a remark attributed to
Muhallab in the Mūsā-legend, which is frequently contradicted
elsewhere both expressly and by implication.</p>

<p>Mufa<i>dd</i>al, during his nine months of office in 85/704,
seems to have endeavoured to impress <i>H</i>ajjāj by a show
of military activity against the rebels in Bādghīs. At the
same time, acting in concert with the local princes
(magnified in the legend to “<i>T</i>arkhūn and as-Sabal”),
he sent an expedition to Tirmidh under ʿOthmān b.
Ma<i>s</i>ʿūd. Mūsā was cut off and killed in a sortie and his
nephew Sulaymān surrendered at discretion, <i>H</i>ajjāj’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
first exclamation on hearing the news is said to have been
one of anger at the insult to Qays, but the last hindrance
to the appointment of the new governor was now removed
and towards the close of the year Qutayba b. Muslim
arrived in Merv.</p>

<h2 id="III_THE_CONQUESTS_OF_QUTAYBA">III. THE CONQUESTS OF QUTAYBA</h2>

<p>The achievements of the Muslim armies in Central Asia
during the reign of Walīd I were due in the first place to
the complete co-operation between the directive genius of
<i>H</i>ajjāj and the military capacity of Qutayba. Qutayba’s
strategic abilities have been somewhat overrated, though
the Arabic texts are at no pains to conceal the fact that
his gifts fell something short of genius. On more than
one occasion we are shown in what constant touch the
viceroy was kept with the progress of his armies, and how
large a part he took in drawing up the plan of campaign,
though the credit of carrying it through to a successful
issue rightly belongs to Qutayba. <i>H</i>ajjāj seems to have
had the fullest confidence in his lieutenant, and if he did
not hesitate to utter reproof and warning when occasion
required, he was equally quick to express appreciation of
Qutayba’s success. The Arabs of all parties soon realised
that behind their general lay the authority of <i>H</i>ajjāj, the
wholesome respect inspired by whom prevented any open
breach during his lifetime. The second factor which
materially assisted the conquests was that in their prosecution
Qutayba united all parties in Khurāsān, Persians
and Arabs, Qays and Yemen. It was no small matter to
keep their enthusiasm unabated in the face of campaigns
so protracted and severe, nor can the enthusiasm be
explained only by the attraction of a rich booty. It is
by no means improbable that Qutayba’s success was
really due more to his talent for administration than to his
generalship. He seems to have realised, as no other
Arab governor in the east had yet done, that in such a
province as Khurāsān the safety and security of the
Arab government must depend in the long run on the co-operation
of the Persian populace, who formed so great
a majority in the country. The bitterness of factional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
strife had shown how unsafe it was to rely on the support
of the Arabs alone, especially in the face of such a movement
as Yazīd had provoked. By his conciliatory
attitude, therefore, Qutayba earned the confidence of the
Persians and repaid it with confidence; from his constant
employment of Persian agents and his growing preference
for Persian governors, it would seem even that he
came to regard them as forming the “ʿAshīra” he lacked
among the Arabs. Although it earned him the ill-will
of the Arabs and played a great part in his fall, it may be
that in this he was instrumental in giving the first impulse
to the recovery of a national sentiment amongst the
Persians of Khurāsān.</p>

<p>The situation in Central Asia was also favourable for
a renewal of the attempt to annex to the Arab dominions
the rich lands of Transoxania, though it is doubtful how
much information the Arabs possessed on this point.
In 682, while China, weakened internally by the intrigues
of the Empress Wu, had her hands tied by the wars with
Tibet, the Eastern or Northern Turks had re-asserted
their independence. The new Empire never regained
its authority over all the western territories of the former
Khans, but by constant campaigns had extended its rule
over the Ten Tribes of the Ili and Chu, who, we are
told, were “almost annihilated.” In 701 the Eastern
Turks invaded Sogdiana, but there is no reason to assume,
though it has frequently been suggested, that Muhallab’s
forces at Kish were affected by this raid. As the necessity
of securing hostages for the safety even of the lines of
communication shows, the hostility of the local forces is
sufficient to explain all the encounters narrated. The
devastation and loss that invariably accompanied these
raids must have still further weakened the resources of
the subject princes, to whom there was small consolation
in the appointment of a son of the Khan to command the
Ten Tribes. In any case the unceasing warfare which
the Eastern Turks had to wage against the Türgesh
from 699 to 711 effectually prevented them from sending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
assistance in response to any appeals for support which
may have reached them from Sogdiana<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>. Equally if
not more impossible was it for the Türgesh to intervene
in Sogdiana during the same period<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>. By the “Turks,”
as we have seen, the Arab historians mean as a general
rule the local inhabitants, amongst whom there may
quite possibly have been included at that time Turkish
elements. Occasional references to the Khāqān (unless
they may be taken to refer to local chiefs, which is
improbable) are obvious <i>fakhr</i>-developments. The
narrative of 98 <span class="smcapuc">A.H.</span> on which the theory of Türgesh
intervention is mainly based, is a pure Bāhilite invention.
Finally, the experience of the Arabs in later years shows
us that, if the resistance of Sogdiana had been backed by
large forces of Turks, it would have been impossible for
Qutayba to achieve so large a measure of success.</p>

<p>The conquests of Qutayba fall naturally into four
periods:</p>

<div class="blockquote hanging">

<p>1. 86/705: The recovery of Lower <i>T</i>ukhāristān;</p>

<p>2. From 87/706 to 90/709: The conquest of
Bukhārā;</p>

<p>3. From 91/710 to 93/712: Consolidation of the
Arab authority in the Oxus valley and its extension
into <i>S</i>ughd;</p>

<p>4. From 94/713 to 96/715: Expeditions into the
Jaxartes provinces.</p>

</div>

<h3 class="left"><i>The recovery of Lower <span class="antiqua">T</span>ukhāristān.</i></h3>

<p>The first task before Qutayba was to crush the
revolt of Lower <i>T</i>ukhāristān. In the spring of 86/705
the army was assembled and marched through Merv
Rūdh and <i>T</i>ālaqān on Balkh. According to one of
<i>T</i>abarī’s narratives the city was surrendered without a
blow. A second account, which, though not explicitly
given as Bāhilite, may be regarded as such, since it
centres on Qutayba’s brother and is intended to
establish a Bāhilite claim on the Barmakids, speaks of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
revolt amongst some of the inhabitants. This may
perhaps be the more correct version, since we hear of
Balkh being in a ruinous condition four years later
(<i>T</i>ab. 1206. 1). The submission of Balkh was followed
by that of Tīsh, king of Chaghāniān, who had probably
cooperated with Mufa<i>dd</i>al in the attack on Tirmidh the
year before. His action was, it seems, inspired by a feud
with the king of Shūmān and Ākharūn, in the upper
valleys of the Surkhan and Penjab rivers, against whom
he hoped to use the Arab troops in return for his assistance
to them. Mufa<i>dd</i>al had actually projected an
expedition against Shūmān before his recall, and it was
now carried out by Qutayba, who was perhaps the more
ready to undertake it since it assured the safety of the
southern approach to the Iron Gate. After the submission
of the King Ghīslashtān, who was of Turkish blood,
according to Yuan Chwang, Qutayba returned to Merv
alone, leaving the army to follow under his brother
Sāli<i>h</i>, who carried out a number of minor raids on the
way. It is obvious that, in spite of Balādhurī’s imaginative
account, these raids must be located in the districts
neighbouring on the Oxus. The readings in <i>T</i>abarī’s
narrative are, however, defective<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>. Having thus
isolated Nēzak in Bādghīs, the heart of the revolt,
Qutayba spent the winter months in negotiating with
him through Sulaym “the Counsellor,” an influential
Persian whose skill in conducting the most difficult
negotiations proved more than once of the utmost
value to Qutayba. Nēzak was persuaded to surrender
and was conducted to Merv, where peace was concluded
on condition that Qutayba would not enter Bādghīs
in person. As a precautionary measure however the
governor arranged that Nēzak should accompany him
in all his expeditions. Thus for the moment at least, the
danger of an outbreak in Khurāsān was averted, in a
manner honourable to both parties, and the son of Pērōz
took his way back to China to await a more favourable
opportunity<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<h3 class="left"><i>The Conquest of Bukhārā.</i></h3>

<p>In the following year, Qutayba, first making sure of
the crossings at Āmul and Zamm, opened his campaigns
in Bukhārā with an attack on Paykand. From the
expressions of Narshakhī, on whose history of this period
we may place more reliance since his details as a rule
fit in with and supplement the other histories, it
can be gathered that the principality of Bukhārā was
weakened by civil war and invasion. During the minority
of <i>T</i>ughshāda and the regency of Khātūn, the ambitious
nobles had struggled between themselves for the chief
power; most of the territories, including Bukhārā itself,
had been seized by the prince of Wardāna and the remaining
districts seem to have been brought under the
rule of Khunuk Khudāh, a noble who assumed the title
of Bukhār Khudāh<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>. Paykand was thus more or less
isolated and, from Narshakhī’s account, seems to have
been left to its fate. The battle with the <i>S</i>ughdians
related in <i>T</i>abarī is an obvious anticipation from the
events of the following year. After a siege of some two
months the city came to terms with Qutayba, who left
it under a small garrison and, according to <i>T</i>abarī’s
version, began the return march to Merv. An émeute in
Paykand, however, brought him back at once. It seems
reasonable to assume that the citizens, imagining
Qutayba’s attack to have been no more than an isolated
raid, tried to expel the garrison as soon as he retired.
The details given in Narshakhī, that on Qutayba’s advance
towards Bukhārā a certain citizen, enraged by
the insulting conduct of the governor, Warqāʾ b. Nasr
al-Bāhili, attempted to murder him, are trivial and
unconvincing. Whatever the cause of the revolt may
have been, however, Qutayba took a terrible revenge.
In accordance with mediaeval practice the renegade city
was sacked, its fighting men put to death, and its women
and children enslaved. The booty taken from this, the
first of the great trading cities of Central Asia to be
forcibly captured by the Arabs, furnished inexhaustible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
material for the exaggerated details of later tradition.
The most important part of the spoil was an arsenal of
weapons and armour, the excellence of which was such
that the “forging of <i>S</i>ughd” appears in contemporary
verse alongside the traditional “forging of David” for
superlative craftsmanship<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>. With the consent of
<i>H</i>ajjāj, these weapons were not included in the division
of the booty but used to re-equip the army. The statement
that there were only 350 suits of armour in the whole
army before this is, however, of Bāhilite provenance and
scarcely worthy of credence. The exemplary punishment
thus meted out by Qutayba to Paykand at the
beginning of his career was a stern warning to Nēzak and
the Sogdians. Those who accepted Arab dominion would
be humanely treated, but any attempt at rebellion would
be inexorably crushed. Nevertheless the sentence on
Paykand was somewhat mitigated in the sequel, as
Narshakhī adds that the captives were ransomed by the
merchants of Paykand on their return from the annual
trading expedition to China, and the city, after lying in
ruins for many years, was eventually rebuilt.</p>

<p>The disaster at Paykand roused the princes and
merchants of Transoxania to the danger of neglecting the
invaders. The feud between Wardāna and Bukhārā
was patched up; round Wardān Khudāh, the central
figure and organiser of the struggle for independence,
gathered the forces of all the nearer principalities. Thus
when Qutayba, on renewing his expedition in 88/707,
had taken the outlying town of Tūmushkath (not Nūmushkath,
which was the earlier name of Bukhārā) and
Rāmīthana (or Rāmtīn), he found his communications
cut by the troops of Wardāna, Bukhārā, and <i>S</i>ughd.
It is not, perhaps, impossible that the prince of Farghāna
should have cooperated with the <i>S</i>ughdians, as stated in
Madāʾinī’s account. On the other hand the Arabic
narratives are far from explicit, and the <i>S</i>ughdians here
referred to are much more probably those of Kish than of
Samarqand, a suspicion which is confirmed by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
famous punning order of <i>H</i>ajjāj: “Crush Kish, destroy
Nasaf, and drive Wardān back.” Narshakhī and Yaʿqūbī
give an account of the negotiations between
<i>H</i>ayyān an-Naba<i>t</i>ī, representing Qutayba, and <i>T</i>arkhūn
king of <i>S</i>ughd, which is certainly to be put, with <i>T</i>abarī,
after the conquest of Bukhārā two years later. Throughout
all these campaigns there is manifest a tendency,
common to the early chronicles of all nations, to exaggerate
the numbers and composition of the opposing forces.
As usual the Bāhilite account carries this to the point of
absurdity by introducing a Türgesh force of no less than
200,000 men, an obvious anachronism, influenced by the
later Türgesh invasions. The connection is made clear
by the mention of Kūr Maghānūn, whom we find nearly
thirty years later (<i>T</i>ab. II. 1602. 2) as “one of the chiefs
of the Türgesh.” The true account would seem to be
that Qutayba did not attempt to fight a pitched battle,
but by dilatory tactics wearied out the allies and gave
time for their natural inclination towards disunion to
operate, then evaded them by a rapid march through the
Iron Gate and, except for a rearguard skirmish with the
enemy’s cavalry, got his army clear across the river at
Tirmidh. The appointment of ʿAbdur-Ra<i>h</i>mān ibn
Muslim to command the rearguard gives us the clue, as
it was to this brother that Qutayba regularly entrusted
all the most difficult commands. In the following year
Qutayba was still unable to make headway against the
united forces of Wardān Khudāh, Kish and Nasaf, and
after protracted fighting (in spite of the double victory
claimed by the Bāhilites) returned to Merv. For this
weakness he was severely reprimanded by <i>H</i>ajjāj, who,
with the aid of a map, drew up a plan of attack. The
invasion of 90/709 seems to have taken Wardān Khudāh
by surprise, as the Muslim army was able to advance at
once to the siege of Bukhārā. There is some ground for
the conjecture, however, that the death of Wardān
Khudāh had occurred in the interval and that Qutayba
was opposed only by the local forces<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>. This may also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
explain the hesitation of the forces of Samarqand to intervene.
The battle before the walls of Bukhārā is described
by <i>T</i>abarī in a long Tamīmite tradition reminiscent
of the ancient “days,” but the actual capture of the city
is left to be inferred. This siege is transferred to
Wardāna by Vámbéry (<i>cf.</i> <i>Heart of Asia</i> p. 52)
probably on the authority of the Persian <i>T</i>abarī (Zotenberg
IV. 165), but Narshakhī, <i>T</i>abarī and all other
authorities quite definitely refer to Bukhārā. Abū
ʿUbayda’s tradition (Bal. 420) of capture by treachery is
at best a confusion with the capture of Samarqand. All
the details given in Narshakhī relative to Qutayba’s
organisation of Bukhārā do not refer to this year; most
probably the only immediate measures taken were the
imposition of a tribute of 200,000 dirhems and the occupation
of the citadel by an Arab garrison.</p>

<p>A diplomatic success followed the victory at Bukhārā.
<i>T</i>arkhūn, king of Samarqand, opened negotiations with
Qutayba, who was represented by the commander of his
Persian corps, <i>H</i>ayyān an-Naba<i>t</i>ī, and terms were agreed
upon, probably on the basis of the old treaty made by
Salm ibn Ziyād. <i>T</i>arkhūn gave hostages for the payment
of tribute and Qutayba began the march back to Merv.</p>

<h3 class="left"><i>Consolidation and Advance.</i></h3>

<p>If the Arabs returned in the autumn of 90/709 elated
with their success, they were soon given fresh cause for
anxiety. Nēzak, finally realising that all hope of recovering
independence must be extinguished if Arab rule was
strengthened in Khurāsān, and perhaps putting down to
weakness Qutayba’s willingness to gain his ends if possible
by diplomacy, determined on a last effort to overthrow
Muslim sovereignty in Lower <i>T</i>ukhāristān, at the moment
when it was least to be expected. Having obtained
permission to revisit his home, he left Qutayba at Āmul
and made for Balkh, but escaped to <i>T</i>ukhāristān in order
to avoid re-arrest. From here he corresponded with the
rulers of Balkh, Merv Rūdh, <i>T</i>ālaqān, Fāryāb, and Jūzjān,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
urging them to undertake a concerted rising in the
spring. The king of Chaghāniān seems to have refused
to countenance the conspiracy, but the weak Jabghu of
<i>T</i>ukhāristān was induced, possibly by force, to make
common cause with Nēzak, who hoped doubtless by this
means to unite all the subject princes in defence of their
suzerain.</p>

<p>Qutayba’s army was already disbanded and the
winter was setting in. All that he could do was to despatch
the garrison at Merv, some 12,000 men, under
ʿAbdur-Ra<i>h</i>mān, with instructions to winter in Balkh,
where they could counter any immediate move by
Nēzak, and advance into <i>T</i>ukhāristān in the spring.
This resolute action made Qutayba master of the situation
and so intimidated the rebels that when, in the early
spring, the Arabs marched through the disaffected
districts, scarcely a blow was struck and the princes either
submitted or fled. The inhabitants were granted a
complete amnesty except at <i>T</i>alāqān, concerning which
the traditions are hopelessly confused. According to one
account, a band of robbers were there executed and
crucified, but it is possible that it was selected for special
severity because there alone the revolt had openly broken
out<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>. There was probably also some reorganization
of the administration of Lower <i>T</i>ukhāristān, in the
direction of conferring fuller powers on the Arab governors
installed in each district, though the native princes continued
to exercise a nominal authority. From Balkh,
Qutayba marched forward and rejoined ʿAbdur-Ra<i>h</i>mān.
With the assistance of the lesser princes they
pursued and captured Nēzak, who was subsequently
executed on direct orders from <i>H</i>ajjāj, in violation of
Qutayba’s promise of pardon<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>. How little this action
was condemned by the prevailing spirit of the age, however,
is shown by the contemporary poems quoted by
<i>T</i>abarī, lauding the “defender of the precincts of Islam”
and comparing his action to the measures formerly
adopted against the Jewish tribes of Madīna. Yet even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
at this time we find traces of the new spirit that was to
make itself more felt in later years, and hear voices raised,
like Thābit Qu<i>t</i>na’s, against the “treachery that calls
itself resolution.” <i>T</i>abarī inserts at this point the
narrative of the putting to death of the hostages of
Jūzjān, in retaliation for the murder of the Arab hostage
in Jūzjān, a much more excusable incident. Balādhurī
puts it at the beginning of Qutayba’s career, however,
as though it belonged to the first pacification of Lower
<i>T</i>ukhāristān, so that its position in <i>T</i>abarī may possibly
be due to its superficial similarity with the case of Nēzak.
The results of this expedition were of the greatest importance:
not only was Nēzak’s scheme crushed and Lower
<i>T</i>ukhāristān henceforth incorporated in the Arab Empire,
but also for the first time Arab authority was extended
over the Jabghu and his immediate vassals in the Oxus
basin. The former, exiled to Damascus, formed a valuable
hostage against any attempt to regain independence,
and it seems not improbable that the king of Chaghāniān
was made regent for the young Jabghu (see above, <a href="#Page_9">p. 9</a>),
ʿAbdur-Ra<i>h</i>mān was appointed governor of Balkh, in
order to supervise the administration of the new
province.</p>

<p>Qutayba had hardly returned to Merv before he was
called to deal with yet another revolt. The king of
Shūmān, taking advantage of the difficulties of the Arabs,
or of their absence in the southern mountains, had re-asserted
his independence in spite of the conciliatory
offers of Sāli<i>h</i> ibn Muslim. The full weight of Qutayba’s
power was now employed to crush him. His stronghold
was attacked with siege artillery, the king himself killed
in a sortie and the garrison put to the sword. From this
point Shūmān and Ākharūn gradually drop out of the
Arabic narratives altogether. Qutayba then resumed his
march through the Iron Gate, reduced the districts of
Kish and Nasaf, and revisited Bukhārā. There seems
to have been continual friction between the Arab garrison
and the population<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> and it was felt that a drastic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
re-organisation was necessary. <i>T</i>ughshāda, though still
a youth, was restored to the position of Bukhār-Khudāh,
and the leaders of the hostile party (more probably that
of Khunuk Khudāh than Wardān Khudāh) were put to
death. By this means, Qutayba no doubt hoped to
secure compliance and docility in the native administration.
<i>T</i>ughshāda had been raised to the throne by the
Arabs and it might be expected that he would side with
them in consequence. A more solid guarantee for the
permanence of the conquest, however, was the establishment
of a military colony in Bukhārā. Following the
precedent set in the colonization of Merv, Arabs were
lodged in the houses of the inhabitants, and it is said that
the latter were encouraged to attend the Friday prayer
and behave as Muslims by the distribution of a small
gratuity. The Kushan merchants left their homes and
property rather than comply with these orders and
founded a new city outside the walls, but it is evident that
the Islamization of the city was not yet so thorough as
the traditions assert<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>. The building of the Mosque
and the organization of the Friday services are dated by
Narshakhī in 94 <span class="smcapuc">A.H.</span>, which points to a further organization
of the city after the capture of Samarqand. The
organization of the new territories proceeded, in fact,
<i>pari passu</i> with the extension and consolidation of the
conquests. So long as the Arab authority was insecure
in Cisoxania, it was out of the question to establish
either military colonies or an elaborate administration
beyond the river. Consequently, it was only now that
the failure of Nēzak’s revolt had definitely secured the
Arab dominion in the former Ephthalite lands that it
was possible to take the decisive step of settling an Arab
garrison in Bukhārā. The regularity with which each
step followed the last suggests that it was done according
to a prearranged plan, or at least that some attention
had been devoted to the question of the administration
of the occupied territories in the event of the success of
the military operations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>Qutayba’s reorganization was not confined to the
civil government, however, but extended to the army as
well. Hitherto the jealousy of the Arabs for their
exclusive rights as a warrior caste had strictly limited
the number of Persians in the armies, apart from the
clients and camp followers. Thus we are told (<i>T</i>ab. 1290.
20) that the armies of Khurāsān at this period were
composed as follows: from Ba<i>s</i>ra-Ahl al-ʿĀliya, 9,000;
Bakr, 7,000; Tamīm, 10,000; ʿAbd al Qays, 4,000;
Azd, 10,000: from Kūfa, 7,000: and alongside these
47,000 Arabs only 7,000 Mawālī, commanded by <i>H</i>ayyān-an-Naba<i>t</i>ī,
who is called variously a Daylamite and a
native of Khurāsān. Now, however, Qutayba imposed,
first on Bukhārā, and later on each successive conquest,
the obligation of providing an auxiliary corps of local
troops, amounting usually to some ten or twenty thousand
men, to serve with the Arab armies. It is possible, if
the story be true, that this was suggested by the precedent
set by Saʿīd b. ʿOthmān in the conquest of Samarqand,
but more probable that it represents an entirely new
departure in the East, though it had long been a practice
in other spheres of the Arab conquests.</p>

<p>We are given no hint of the motives which led to the
adoption of the new system, though it would seem that
they must have been of some force. Possibly it was no
more than a desire to keep the native armies occupied
in the service of the Arabs rather than risk a revolt in
their rear. <i>H</i>ajjāj and Qutayba perhaps realised too
that the Arab forces by themselves, after taking four
years to reduce Bukhārā alone, were insufficient to ensure
success in the greater task of subduing Samarqand.
Under the new system—which recalls Pan-chʿao’s famous
aphorism “Use barbarians to attack barbarians”—each
conquest in turn made the next more easy. The
rapidity of Qutayba’s later conquests in contrast with
the early period is thus explained. It is just possible
that in this plan Qutayba had an ulterior motive as well:
the formation of a Persian army, trained on the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
lines as the Arab forces, but more devoted to the person
of the governor and able to take his part against the
Arabs. How very nearly this plan succeeded, even in
Qutayba’s own case, the sequel was to show.</p>

<p>The practice of raising native levies, once started,
appears to have become general in Khurāsān. We have
no information as to when the local forces of Khurāsān
and Lower <i>T</i>ukhāristān were incorporated in the army,
nor in what proportions, but we have frequent evidence
of their presence and increasing prestige in the wars of
the next forty years<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>. On the other hand, though
contingents from the towns of Sogdiana were used by
later governors if they were available, as in 106 and 112
<span class="smcapuc">A.H.</span>, in view of the weaker hold of the Arabs on Transoxania
Sogdian troops never formed a regular division
of the Arab forces up to the end of the Umayyad period.
This distinction between the two subject Iranian groups
became, as will be seen, of some importance when the
ʿAbbāsid propaganda began to tamper with the loyalty
of the armies of Khurāsān.</p>

<p>While Qutayba was occupied with the new organization
of Bukhārā, a detached force, sent under ʿAbdur-Ra<i>h</i>mān
from Kish to Samarqand to exact from <i>T</i>arkhūn
the tribute agreed upon in the previous year, successfully
accomplished its mission. ʿAbdur-Ra<i>h</i>mān, after
restoring the hostages to <i>T</i>arkhūn, rejoined his brother at
Bukhārā, whence they returned to Merv for the winter.</p>

<p>One important vassal of <i>T</i>ukhāristān, who had long
been a thorn in the side of <i>H</i>ajjāj, still remained unsubdued.
This was Rutbīl or Zunbīl, the Turkish ruler of
Zābulistān<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>. In 91, the viceroy united Sijistān to
the province of Khurāsān, with instructions to Qutayba
to undertake a campaign in person against Rutbīl. In
the following year, therefore, the expeditions into Transoxania
were interrupted, and the army again marched
southwards. To Qutayba’s great relief (for he disliked
to undertake a campaign against this formidable foe
who had made Sijistān “an ill-omened frontier”)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Rutbīl hastened to tender his submission, and at the same
time sent an embassy to convey his homage to the
Emperor of China<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>. Recognition of Arab suzerainty
over Zābulistān involved of course only the payment of
a fixed tribute, and no attempt was made at a permanent
occupation.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a serious situation had arisen in <i>S</i>ughd.
The merchants and nobles of Samarqand had resented
the weakness of their king and the payment of tribute:
in Qutayba’s absence the party for resistance <i>à outrance</i>
gained the upper hand, and <i>T</i>arkhūn, deposed on the
ground of incapacity, committed suicide. The choice
of the electors fell on Ghūrak<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>, a prince of whom we
would gladly have known more. Under the ever increasing
difficulties with which he was confronted during his
twenty-seven years of rule, his consummate handling
of the most confused situations shows him to have been
at once statesman and patriot, and preserved his kingdom
from repeated disaster. The action of the <i>S</i>ughdian
nobles, however, the Arabic account of which is confirmed
by the Chinese records, constituted a challenge to Arab
pretensions which Qutayba could not be slow in answering.
These considerations clearly disprove the partial
tradition of Abū ʿUbayda (Bal. 422), to the effect that
Qutayba treacherously attacked Khwārizm and Samarqand
in spite of the treaties of Saʿīd ibn ʿOthmān, and the
argument based upon it by van Vloten in <i>La Domination
Arabe</i>, must also, in consequence, be somewhat modified.</p>

<p>The winter of 93/711, therefore, was spent in preparations
for an expedition against Samarqand, but
before the opening of the campaigning season, Qutayba
received a secret mission from the Khwārizm Shāh,
who offered to become tributary if the Arabs would rid
him of his rebellious brother Khurrazādh. Qutayba
agreed, and after publicly announcing his intention of
invading <i>S</i>ughd, suddenly appeared at Hazārasp. The
followers of the Khwārizm Shāh were persuaded to offer
no resistance for this year, at least, and accepted the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
terms, which included, in accordance with the new
scheme, the provision of a corps of 10,000 ablebodied
men as well as the usual tribute. Qutayba remained at
the capital<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> until the army was collected, while
ʿAbdur-Ra<i>h</i>mān was employed, according to <i>T</i>abarī, in
reducing the king of Khāmjird, who from the parallel
account in Balādhurī is to be identified either with
Khurrazādh, or at least with his party. The Persian
<i>T</i>abarī adds a long and doubtless legendary narrative
of his surrender. Four thousand prisoners were taken
and butchered, probably by order of the Khwārizm Shāh.</p>

<p>The later history of Khwārizm under Qutayba’s rule
is an unhappy one. His first governor Iyās b. ʿAbdullah,
proved too weak for his post, and on Qutayba’s withdrawal
the Khwārizmians rose in revolt and put to death
the king who had betrayed them. Iyās was recalled in
disgrace, together with the Persian <i>H</i>ayyān an-Naba<i>t</i>ī,
who had been associated with him, and Qutayba’s
brother ʿAbdullah (in Balādhurī ʿUbaydullah) was
appointed as temporary regent until, after the capture
of Samarqand, a strong force under al-Mughīra b.
ʿAbdullah could be sent to effect a reconquest. Qutayba’s
retribution on this occasion exceeded even the terror of
Paykand and Shūmān. We are told by Al-Bīrūnī that
the educated classes and more cultured elements in
Khwārizm were slaughtered almost to extinction. He
refers this by implication to the second expedition of
Qutayba (though it does not appear that the governor
led the expedition in person), which is borne out by what
we know of Qutayba’s methods in similar cases, while
there is no instance in his career of such an action on a
first conquest. It was in all probability the educated
classes (including no doubt the hierarchy) who led the
revolt against the traitor king and thus met with the
severest punishment. The dynasty, however, was
maintained, and it is not improbable that the Arab colony
of which we hear shortly afterwards was settled in
Khwārizm at the same time<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>The booty from the first expedition into Khwārizm
was enough to satisfy Qutayba’s troops, who demanded
to be allowed to return to their homes, but a
sudden thrust at Samarqand promised such success that
Qutayba and his leaders decided to make the attempt.
The <i>S</i>ughdian army had apparently been disbanded,
and under cover of a false movement of the advance
guard, the Arabs marched directly on Samarqand. The
advance guard under ʿAbdur-Ra<i>h</i>mān numbered 20,000
men, while the main body included the new Persian
contingents from Khwārizm and Bukhārā. The march
occupied only a few days and the slight resistance encountered
did not prevent the Arabs from proceeding
at once to invest the city. Ghūrak conducted the defence
with vigour, however, and appealed to Shāsh and Farghāna
for assistance, reminding them that Samarqand was
the bulwark of the Jaxartes valley. A strong force was
despatched from Shāsh with the intention of making a
surprise attack on the Arab camp, but was ambushed at
night by a picked troop of Arabs and almost annihilated.
This reverse, together with the continuous bombardment
to which they were subjected, disheartened the <i>S</i>ughdians,
but the wall had been breached and an entrance almost
effected by the Arabs, stoutly assisted by their new
Iranian divisions, before Ghūrak sued for peace.
Qutayba’s demands were unexpectedly light—an annual
tribute, stated in widely varying amounts, and a strong
corps of <i>S</i>ughdians, together with a stipulation that the
city should be cleared of its fighting men while the Arabs
built a mosque and celebrated the ritual prayers. Once
within the gates, however, Qutayba refused to restore
the city to Ghūrak: a strong garrison was established
in the citadel, under the command of ʿAbdur-Ra<i>h</i>mān
(so Yaʿqūbī; in <i>T</i>abarī ʿAbdullah) and drastic orders
were issued excluding all unbelievers except under strict
surveillance, doubtless with the intention of avoiding
a repetition of the friction that had occurred at Bukhārā.
Ghūrak either could not or would not place himself in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
the humiliating position of <i>T</i>ughshāda, and with his
retinue, accompanied possibly by the merchants, withdrew
from Samarqand altogether and built a new city, Farankath,
some four farsakhs distant in the direction of
Ishtīkhan[58]. Qutayba’s double-dealing on this
occasion, however, tarnished his reputation among both
Persians and Arabs, far more than his severity to Paykand
and Khwārizm, and left a rankling memory in <i>S</i>ughd.
In order to avoid the stigma of treachery attaching to
their hero the Bāhilite tradition relates this expedition
in an entirely different version<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>. Qutayba, we are
told, after marching down the right bank of the Oxus
and collecting his army at Bukhārā, advanced to Rabinjān
where he was met by the <i>S</i>ughdians under Ghūrak,
supported by the troops of Shāsh and Farghāna and the
Turks. The enemy retired on Samarqand but engaged
in constant rearguard actions, the city being finally
entered by force after a decisive battle in the suburbs.
Though this account is at first sight borne out to some
extent by Ghūrak’s own narrative in his letter to the
Emperor of China, in which he claims an initial success
against the Arabs, but was unable to prevent their
advance, both statements must be regarded as exaggerations
in opposite interests. At all events it is quite
certain that none but <i>S</i>ughdian troops were involved at
first.</p>

<p>A further development of the Bāhilite tradition has
given rise to some controversy. According to this,
Ghūrak appealed for help not only to Shāsh but also to
the Khāqān, and the squadron sent from Shāsh appears
as a force of Turks, commanded by a son of the Khāqān.
This is, of course, an obvious exaggeration on the former
narrative. In the Turkish Orkhon inscriptions, however,
an expedition under the prince Kül-tegin into Sogdiana
“to organize the Sogdian people” is mentioned, following
on a successful campaign against the Türgesh in 710/711.
Marquart endeavours to prove that this expedition
occurred in 712 and is, in fact, corroborated by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
Bāhilite tradition. Professor Houtsma has raised
several objections to this view, the most important being
that the chronology of the inscriptions has to be manipulated
to allow of this date, as the natural date to assume
from the context is at latest 711. These, together with
the considerations mentioned above, render Marquart’s
hypothesis absolutely untenable.</p>

<p>A second suggestion has been put forward by Professor
Barthold, to which, however, Professor Houtsma’s
objections would apply with equal force<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>. In the
narrative of the historian Yaʿqūbī (II. 344), there is a
brief notice as follows: “Qutayba appointed his brother
ʿAbdur-Ra<i>h</i>mān ibn Muslim governor of Samarqand,
but the men of Samarqand treacherously revolted against
him, and Khāqān, king of the Turks, attacked him also.
He wrote to Qutayba, but Qutayba waited until the
winter cleared, then marched to join him and routed the
army of the Turks.” Professor Barthold takes the view,
therefore, that this is the expedition referred to in the
inscriptions, and attributes the failure of the Turks to
the disastrous effects of a winter campaign in a devastated
land, which so severely disabled them that they could
not face the formidable army that took the field under
Qutayba in the spring. It is questionable, however,
how far Yaʿqūbī’s narrative may be trusted. None of
the other historians give the slightest hint of this
invasion, nor were the results such as we should expect
after a <i>S</i>ughdian revolt. There was no ruthless reconquest,
no stamping out of rebellion in blood. Neither
does the general tenor of Yaʿqūbī’s accounts of Qutayba
inspire confidence. They are not only confused in detail
and chronology—the capture of Samarqand, for instance,
is dated 94 <span class="smcapuc">A.H.</span>—but in some cases are taken from what
we know to be the Bāhilite tradition, and in others,
such as the narrative under discussion and the account of
the conquest of Khwārizm, follow a tradition which
seems irreconcilable with our other information. While
it cannot be said definitely therefore, that Yaʿqūbī’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
statements in this case contain no truth, it is certainly
preferable to regard them as a later development of the
narrative, on the lines of the Bāhilite tradition.</p>

<p>If the chronological objections raised by Professor
Houtsma are sound, there remains still a third possible
solution, which, however, as there is no corroborative
evidence from either the Arabic or Chinese sources, must
remain nothing but a hypothesis. It is surely quite
tenable that Kül-tegin’s “organization of the Sogdian
people” had something to do with the deposition of
<i>T</i>arkhūn and appointment of Ghūrak. With Sogdian
trade playing the most important part which we know
in the Turkish lands, it would be well worth while to try
to prevent the Arabs from obtaining control over it.
The very unexpectedness of the description given to this
expedition shows clearly that there was some motive for
“organization” and it is difficult to see what other
motive there could have been. These circumstances
would render it quite probable that Ghūrak did, in fact,
appeal to the Khāqān for assistance against the Arabs,
but it seems that the growing power of the Türgesh
barred the way into Sogdiana against the Northern
Khanate for the remainder of its short existence.</p>

<p>By the conquest of Samarqand Qutayba finally established
his position in Transoxania. It must not be
assumed, however, as many of the Arab historians give
the impression of assuming, that the holding of Samarqand
meant the conquest of <i>S</i>ughd. All that had been done
was to settle an Arab garrison in a country as yet
unfriendly. It was the duty of the commanders at
Samarqand gradually to extend their authority over the
whole district of <i>S</i>ughd by expeditions and razzias<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>.
There was thus a radical difference between the
conquest of Bukhārā and that of Samarqand. The
former was the result of a series of campaigns in which
the resources of the country had been exhausted and the
province annexed piecemeal. The whole population had
become subjects of the Arabs and were under constant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
surveillance: <i>T</i>ughshāda himself held his rank on sufferance
and was compelled to maintain at least an outward
show of loyalty. But Samarqand had been captured
in one swift thrust; <i>S</i>ughd as a whole was still unsubdued
and only from policy acknowledged the suzerainty of the
Arabs for the time being. “Ghūrak at Ishtīkhan was
free to turn either to the Arabs or to the Turks”<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>.
Nevertheless in the years that followed there is evidence
that friendly relations were formed between the Arab
garrison and many of the local leaders and inhabitants<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>.
The whole country, however, had suffered terribly
in the constant invasions and counter invasions. A
contemporary poet gives a vivid picture of its dissipated
wealth, its ruined and desolate lands:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Daily Qutayba gathers spoil, increasing our wealth with new
wealth: A Bāhilite who has worn the crown till the hair that was
black has whitened. <i>S</i>ughd is subdued by his squadrons, its
people left sitting in nakedness.... As oft as he lights in a land,
his horse leave it furrowed and scarred.”</p>

</div>

<h3 class="left"><i>The Expeditions into the Jaxartes Provinces.</i></h3>

<p>It might perhaps have been expected that Qutayba’s
next object after the capture of Samarqand would be to
establish Arab authority in <i>S</i>ughd as firmly as had been
done in Bukhārā. It would probably have been better
in the end had he done so, but for the moment the attractions
of the “forward policy” which had already proved
so successful were too strong. Instead of concentrating
on the reduction of <i>S</i>ughd, it was decided to push the
frontiers of the Empire further into Central Asia, and
leave the former to be carried out at leisure. Qutayba
therefore crossed to Bukhārā, where 20,000 levies from
Khwārizm, Bukhārā, Kish, and Nasaf had been summoned
to meet him, and marched into <i>S</i>ughd. If there was a
Turkish army wintering in the country, it offered no
considerable resistance to the advance of the Arabs.
In <i>S</i>ughd Qutayba divided his forces into two corps.
The Persian levies were sent in the direction of Shāsh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
while he himself with the Arabs marched on Khujanda
and Farghāna. Our information is brief and lacking in
detail. Of the northern expedition we are told only
that they captured Shāsh and burnt the greater part of it.
Qutayba’s own force had to overcome some resistance
at Khujanda, but eventually reached Kāsān, where it
was rejoined by the other. The geographers refer also to
a battle fought by Qutayba at Mīnak in Ushrūsana, but
against whom is not clear<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>. <i>T</i>abarī (1440. 7)
preserves a tradition that Qutayba appointed an Arab
resident, ʿI<i>s</i>ām b. ʿAbdullah al-Bāhilī, in Farghāna.
If this is true, as seems not unlikely, the appointment was
probably made during this year. The details of the
tradition are quite unacceptable, however. No Arab
governor would ever have taken up his residence in a hill-pass
in the remotest district of Farghāna, completely
cut off from his fellow-countrymen. One of Balādhurī’s
authorities carries this or a similar tradition further by
crediting Qutayba with the establishment of Arab
colonies as far as Shāsh and Farghāna. Here again at
most only temporary military outposts can be in question.
On the other hand, the extraordinary success achieved
by the Arabs on this expedition is apt to be overlooked,
and Qutayba might well have imagined, as he returned to
Merv, that the latest conquests were as permanently
annexed to Khurāsān as Samarqand and Khwārizm.</p>

<p>The helplessness of their Turkish suzerain in face of
the victorious Arabs, however, caused a revival in Transoxania
of the tradition of Chinese overlordship. Appeals
to the Khāqān were of no avail, and in the minds of the
Sogdian princes, seeking for some counterpoise to the
rapid extension of the Arab conquests, the idea of appealing
directly to the Emperor was slowly maturing. Though
no definite steps in this direction had as yet been taken,
some inkling of it may have reached Qutayba. The
Arabs were now familiar with China through the sea-borne
trade of the Persian Gulf and at least after, if not
before, their conquest of the cities which were already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
becoming the headquarters of Central Asian commerce,
must have become aware of the close commercial relations
which these cities maintained with China. Under these
circumstances, Qutayba (or possibly <i>H</i>ajjāj) decided to
send a mission overland to the Chinese court, possibly
to prevent their intervention in the West, but more probably
with the intention of promoting trade relations.
As the princes of Sogdiana and <i>T</i>ukhāristān were much
more alive to the advantages of preserving their commerce
and to the dangers which might befall it under the new
government than the Arabs could have been, it was
probably on their suggestion that the embassy was sent.
They would, of course, have no difficulty in persuading
governors of the character of <i>H</i>ajjāj and Qutayba that
their own interests also lay in safeguarding and encouraging
the trade which brought such wealth to Transoxania.
If the intervention of the Turks had been caused by their
concern for Sogdian trade, it became doubly important
for the Arabs to show their practical interest in its welfare.
Apart from the immediate gain to the treasury which
would accrue, such an action might reasonably be expected
to secure the acquiescence of the Sogdians in Arab rule.
The date of the mission is fixed as 713 by the Chinese
records, which add also that in spite of the refusal of the
envoys to perform the customary kow-tow it was favourably
received by the Emperor. Both statements are
confirmed by <i>T</i>abarī’s remark that the leader was sent
to Walīd on his return, which must therefore be dated
between the death of <i>H</i>ajjāj and the end of 714<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>.
Unfortunately the Arab records of the mission have been
confused with the legendary exploits of Qutayba two
years later, becoming so disfigured in the process as to be
almost worthless. The wisdom of this step must have
been justified by its results, though there are no effects
apparent in our histories and the relentless march of
Chinese policy was not affected. This embassy is
mentioned by the Arabic historians as if it were an isolated
incident, but it was, as I have shown elsewhere[65],<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
only the first of many such sent by the governors of
Khurāsān to maintain friendly relations with the Chinese
court. It cannot be doubted that in the majority of
cases at least the object of these missions was commercial,
particularly where joint embassies were sent with one or
other of the Sogdian principalities.</p>

<p>In the following year 95/714 the raids on the Jaxartes
provinces were renewed. It would seem on comparing
Balādhurī’s account with <i>T</i>abarī that Qutayba made
Shāsh his headquarters and worked northwards as far as
Isbījāb. The prince of Shāsh appealed to China for
assistance, but without effect<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>. Qutayba’s plan
therefore was to follow up the important trade-route
which led from Turfan down the Ili valley, along the
northern edge of the Thian-Shan mountains, through
Tokmak and Tarāz into Shāsh and Samarqand. Though
the economic importance of controlling this trade-route
may have had its part in this decision, especially in view
of their new patronage of Sogdian trade, it is probable
that this was less in the mind of the Arabs than its
strategic value as the road by which the Central Asian
Turks debouched on Transoxania. Towards the end of
the summer, the expeditions were abruptly interrupted
by the news of the death of <i>H</i>ajjāj, which had occurred
in Shawwāl (June). Deeply affected by the loss of his
patron and not a little uncertain of the effect on his own
fortunes, Qutayba disbanded the army, sending garrisons
to Bukhārā, Kish, and Nasaf, and returned to Merv.
Walīd, however, allayed his fears by an encouraging letter,
and made his province independent of ʿIrāq. But the
death of <i>H</i>ajjāj had affected Khurāsān too deeply for
such a simple remedy. The Arabs had gained wealth in
their expeditions, they were weary of the constant
campaigns and anxious to enjoy the comforts of peace.
Factional feeling was merely slumbering, and a new element
of unrest had been added by a Kūfan corps under
Jahm b. Za<i>h</i>r, which had been transferred to Khurāsān
from India by <i>H</i>ajjāj in his last year. All parties among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the Arabs were alienated from Qutayba; even Qays had
been estranged by his highhanded action in the first
place with the house of Al-Ahtam and again by his feud
with Wakīʿ b. Abī Sūd, the chief of Tamīm<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>; moreover,
they were suspicious of his medizing tendencies.
Amongst the Persians he was popular, but <i>H</i>ayyān an-Naba<i>t</i>ī,
though restored to his position in command of the
Persian troops, had not forgiven Qutayba for his disgrace
at Khwārizm. It seems extraordinary that the general
himself should have been blind to any internal danger
and was entirely confident in the loyalty of his army.</p>

<p>On re-opening the campaign in 96/715, therefore, his
only precautions consisted in the removal of his family and
personal property from Merv to Samarqand and the posting
of a guard on the Oxus, in view of a possible restoration
to favour of Yazīd b. Muhallab. It is unlikely that
Qutayba could have had in mind the possibility of
Walīd’s death; what he feared was more probably a
<i>rapprochement</i> between the Caliph and his heir Sulaymān,
who was his bitter enemy.</p>

<p>The object of this last campaign was probably the
complete subjugation of Farghāna. Having established
his authority over the important section of the Middle
Jaxartes and its trade route, it remained now to round off
his conquests by extending it also over the central trade
route between Farghāna and Kashgaria. The account
which <i>T</i>abarī intends to convey, however, is that Qutayba
marched first into Farghāna and from there led an
expedition against Kashgar, with complete success. In
an article of mine published in the <i>Bulletin of the
School of Oriental Studies</i> (II. 467 ff.), all our evidence for
this expedition has been critically discussed, and shown to
be against the authenticity of the tradition. It is unnecessary,
therefore, to do more than summarise very
briefly the arguments there put forward. (1) None of
the historians earlier than or contemporary with <i>T</i>abarī
contain any reference to a raid on Kashgar, and even
<i>T</i>abarī’s own statement is not borne out by the authorities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
on which it professedly rests. Only one of these
relates an expedition to Kashgar, and that under the
command of an unknown leader. (2) The interval
between the opening of the campaign and the death of
Qutayba in Farghāna in August or September does not
allow time for such an expedition, especially in view of
the mutinous attitude of the army after the death of the
Caliph. (3) The Chinese account of Arab interference in
Farghāna cannot refer, for chronological reasons, to
Qutayba’s expedition, and in any case is silent on any
attack on Kashgaria.</p>

<p>That an expedition of this sort should have been
attributed to Qutayba is not surprising, in view of the
tradition of the embassy to China, and of the great renown
which attached to his memory. Later tradition<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>
recounted that <i>H</i>ajjāj pledged the governorship of China
to the first to reach it of his two governors in the East,
Mu<i>h</i>ammad b. Qāsim and Qutayba. “<i>S</i>īn” was, of
course, not the sharply defined country of our days, but
rather a loose term for the Far East, including even the
Turkish lands in the North-East. Qutayba had probably
done little more than make preparations for his campaign,
perhaps to the extent of sending out minor raiding
expeditions, when the news of the death of Walīd brought
everything to a standstill.</p>

<p>The historians give the most contradictory accounts
of the events that followed; according to Balādhurī
the new Caliph Sulaymān confirmed Qutayba in his command
but gave permission to the army to disband.
<i>T</i>abarī’s narrative, with which Yaʿqūbī’s in general
agrees, is fully discussed by Wellhausen (274 ff.), together
with a valuable analysis of Qutayba’s position. The
story of his highhanded negotiations with Sulaymān
is too well known to need repetition. Finding the army
disinclined to follow him, he completely lost his head and
roused the mutiny in which he was killed. The Persian
levies, who were inclined to side with him, were dissuaded
by <i>H</i>ayyān an-Naba<i>t</i>ī, and at the last only his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
family and bodyguard of Sogdian princes remained
faithful.</p>

<p>The death of Qutayba marked not merely the end of
the Arab conquests in Central Asia for a quarter of a
century, but the beginning of a period of retrogression.
Under Wakīʿ b. Abī Sūd, his successor<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>, the armies
melted away. Mukhallad, the son of Yazīd b. Muhallab
and his lieutenant in Transoxania, carried out summer
raids on the villages of <i>S</i>ughd, but an isolated attempt on
the Jaxartes provinces by ʿOmar’s governor, Al-Jarrā<i>h</i>
b. ʿAbdullah, met with ignominious failure. It is possibly
to this that the tradition, mentioned by Barthold
(<i>Turkestan</i> 160), of the disaster met with by a Muslim
army refers. On the other hand an embassy was sent in
the name of the Caliph to renew relations with the
Chinese court, and a third in concert with the kingdoms of
<i>T</i>ukhāristān and Samarqand, etc., during the reign of
ʿOmar<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>. There is mention also of an expedition into
Khuttal which regained some territory. But it was
Qutayba, with <i>H</i>ajjāj at his back, who had held his
conquests together, and when he disappeared there was
neither leader nor organisation to take his place. The
history of the next decade clearly shows how loose and
unstable was the authority of the Arabs. It was force
that had made the conquests, and only a settled policy
of force or conciliation could hold them. The first was
absent. “Qutayba in chains at the world’s end is more
terrible to us than Yazīd as governor in our very midst”
is the graphic summary put into the mouths of the
conquered, while of Rutbīl, king of Zābulistān, we are
told expressly that after the death of <i>H</i>ajjāj “he paid
not a cent of tribute to any of the governors of Sijistān
on behalf of the Umayyads nor on behalf of Abū
Muslim.”<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>.</p>

<p>Nor was ʿOmar’s policy a true policy of conciliation,
based as it was not on the maintenance of the Arab
conquests but on the complete evacuation of Transoxania.
His orders to that effect were of course indignantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
rejected by the Arab colonists in Bukhārā and Samarqand,
but together with his appointment of the feeble and
ineffective ʿAbdur-Ra<i>h</i>mān b. Nuʿaym al-Qushayrī as
governor, such a policy was naturally construed by the
Sogdians as mere weakness, and an invitation to regain
their independence. In addition to the embassies to
China, to be related in the next chapter, and possibly also
some negotiations with the Türgesh, Ghūrak sought to
win back his capital by playing on ʿOmar’s piety. The
Caliph sent envoys to the princes of Sogdiana calling on
them to accept Islām, and Ghūrak, outwardly professing
his adherence, sent a deputation to ʿOmar urging that as
“Qutayba dealt with us treacherously and tyrannically,
but God has now caused justice and equity to reign”
the city should be restored to the <i>S</i>ughdians. The
commonsense of the judge appointed to try the case on
ʿOmar’s instructions by the governor of Samarqand,
Sulaymān b. Abiʾs-Sarī (himself a mawlā), solved the
problem in an eminently practical manner, and we are
told that his decision, so far from being “malicious,”
was satisfactory to both the Arabs and the <i>S</i>ughdians, if
not perhaps to Ghūrak. Beyond the remission of kharāj,
it is doubtful whether ʿOmar’s administration benefited
the subject peoples in the slightest, and the reaction
which followed his brief reign only aggravated the
situation. Already before its close the <i>S</i>ughdians had
withdrawn their allegiance<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>.</p>

<p>Thus within six years from the death of Qutayba,
much of his work was undone. He had laid the foundations
on which the later rule of Islām was built, and laid
them well, though his own superstructure was too flimsy
to withstand the tempests of the years ahead. But the
fault was not entirely, perhaps not even chiefly, the fault
of the builder. He was snatched away before his work
was done, even if in his latter years he tended to neglect
everything else for military glory. As we shall see, there
was no peace in Transoxania until other men arose, great
and strong enough to adopt and carry out the best of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
his plans. The ruthlessness and ferocity of his conquests,
however, have been much exaggerated. He was always
ready to use diplomacy rather than force if it offered any
hope of success, so much so that his lenience was misconstrued
on occasion by both friends and foes. Only
in cases of treachery and revolt his punishment came swift
and terrible. That he did not hesitate to take vengeance
on his private enemies is to say no more than that he was
an Arab. It was not without reason that in later days
the Muslims of Central Asia added Qutayba’s name to
the roll of martyrs and that his tomb in Farghāna became
a favourite place of pilgrimage<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>.</p>

<p>To sum up the position in Central Asia in the years
immediately following Qutayba’s conquests:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(1) Lower <i>T</i>ukhāristān and Chaghāniān formed an
integral part of the Arab Empire.</p>

<p>(2) <i>T</i>ukhāristān, now in the decay of its power, was
held as a vassal state, together with the Transoxine
provinces of Khuttal, Kumādh, etc., where, however, the
Arab authority was much weaker.</p>

<p>(3) In Sogdiana, Bukhārā was regarded as a permanent
conquest and gradually colonized; <i>S</i>ughd was
still hostile territory held by strong outpost garrisons in
Samarqand and Kish, connected to Bukhārā by minor
posts.</p>

<p>(4) Khwārizm as a military power was negligible and
was permanently colonized.</p>

<p>(5) The kingdoms beyond the Jaxartes remained
independent, hostile, and relatively strong, supported
by the Turkish power to the North East and also by the
intervention of China.</p>

<p>(6) Ushrūsana, though unsubdued, does not seem to
have offered any obstacle to the passage of Arab armies.</p>

<p>(7) The existing dynastic houses were everywhere
maintained, as the representatives of the conquered
peoples and vehicle of the civil administration. The
actual administrative and financial authority in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
territories, however, passed to the Wāli, or agent of the
Arab governor of Khurāsān<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>.</p>

here beleaguered the Afshīn of Ushrūsana is almost certainly due to the
omission of some words or perversion of the text. On the other hand,
there could not be, as in Ibn Hawqal’s account, any question of Musawwida
(“Black Robes”) in the ordinary sense of the term as early as 94
<span class="smcapuc">A.H.</span> and above all in Ushrūsana.
The absence of any reference to levies from <i>S</i>ughd in this expedition
would seem to favour Prof. Barthold’s theory of a <i>S</i>ughdian rising in co-operation
with the Turks. The evidence in favour of an accidental
omission is, however, very strong. At this point <i>T</i>abarī’s narratives, in
contrast to the preceding period, become extremely brief. The levies
from the four states mentioned met Qutayba at Bukhārā and marched
with him into <i>S</i>ughd. Naturally the <i>S</i>ughdian levies would have awaited
his arrival there. Had the omission been intentional it would be difficult
to explain why <i>T</i>abarī did not include some account of the reasons
why <i>S</i>ughdian troops were not summoned. In any case it is certain that
Qutayba would not have left a hostile <i>S</i>ughdian army in his rear, and they
must therefore have taken part in the march to the Jaxartes.</p>

<p>The princes of Transoxania had so long been accustomed
to regard the Arabs as mere marauders that it was some
time before they could realise the loss of their independence.
Though necessity forced them at first to adopt a
conciliatory spirit (as, for example, in their acceptance
of Islām under ʿOmar II), they were dismayed to find all
the machinery of permanent occupation set in motion,
and their authority flouted by tactless and greedy Arab
officials. Such a state of affairs was tolerable only in the
absence of any countering force. The situation was not
stationary for long, however; even before Qutayba’s
death other and disturbing factors had begun to enter.
Our best clue to the complications in Transoxania during
this period is the attitude of Ghūrak, king of <i>S</i>ughd, of
whose movements, fortunately, sufficient indications have
been preserved. In maintaining a precarious balance
between the Türgesh and the Arabs, his true statesman’s
instinct seldom misled him in judging how and when to
act to advantage throughout his troubled reign. In
addition to this we have the evidence, unreliable in detail
but confirmatory in the mass, of the embassies sent by
the subject principalities to the Chinese court. Doubtless
they were despatched in the guise of commercial missions
and in many cases were truly so, but that they frequently
possessed a political character can hardly be denied.
The dates of these embassies as given in the authorities
translated by Chavannes fall naturally into four periods.
In the following list all embassies have been omitted in
which the Arabs are known to have participated or whose
object is known to have had no connection with the Arab
conquests, as well as those which appear to be duplicated,
and those from the minor states:</p>

<p>These four periods, as will be seen, closely correspond
to the fluctuations of Arab authority in Transoxania.</p>

<p>In the same year, 713, that Qutayba first led his army
across the Jaxartes, a new era of westward expansion
opened in China with the accession of Hiuen-Tsong.
In 714 the Chinese intervened in the affairs of the Ten
Tribes and obtained their immediate submission, while
in the following year they restored the deposed king of
Farghāna. In 716, on the death of Me-chuʾo, Khan of
the Northern Turks, the powerful tribes of the Türgesh
asserted their independence, and under their chief Su-Lu
established, with Chinese assistance, a new kingdom in
the Ili basin. The princes of Transoxania eagerly sought
to profit by these developments to free themselves from
the Arab yoke. In 718 a joint embassy was sent to China
by <i>T</i>ughshāda, Ghūrak, Narayāna king of Kumādh,
and the king of Chaghāniān. The first three presented
petitions for aid against the Arabs, which are given in full
in Chavannes’ <i>Documents</i>. <i>T</i>ughshāda asked that the
Türgesh might be ordered to attack the Arabs, Ghūrak
related the capture of Samarqand and asked for Chinese
troops, Narayāna complained of the seizure of all his
treasures by the Arabs and asked that representations
might be made to induce them to remit their crushing
taxation. It is significant that the king of Chaghāniān,
acting for his suzerain, the Jabghu of <i>T</i>ukhāristān, did
not compromise himself by joining in these requests.
But beyond “fair words” the son of Heaven took no
action, and no Chinese forces appeared West of the Jaxartes,
in spite of the repeated entreaties addressed by the
princes to their self-elected suzerain.</p>

<p>The Türgesh, however, were not long in intervening on
their own account. Whatever opportunity the Arab<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
government had to pacify the <i>S</i>ughdians was lost by a
succession of incompetent governors. Already in the
reign of ʿOmar II, as has been seen, they had withdrawn
their allegiance from the weak ʿAbdur-Ra<i>h</i>mān b. Nuʿaym.
For a moment the situation seemed to improve at the
beginning of the governorship of Saʿīd “Khudhayna”
(102/720) owing to the firm handling of Samarqand by
his lieutenant Shuʿba b. <i>Z</i>uhayr. But disturbances
broke out and Shuʿba was recalled, perhaps in a vain
attempt to appease the insurgents. It would seem that
the <i>S</i>ughdians appealed to the new Turkish power in
the East and Su-Lu, unable to make headway against the
growing influence of China, willingly seized the opportunity
of diverting his armies into Transoxania. A small
Türgesh force was sent under Köl-chur (called by <i>T</i>abarī
Kūr<i>s</i>ūl)<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> to make common cause with the <i>S</i>ughdian
rebels in the following spring (end of 102). Saʿīd awoke
to find the whole country in arms, a Turkish force marching
on Samarqand, and the local princes, with few
exceptions, aiding the invaders. The Arab commanders
could not rely on their levies and a small garrison at
Qa<i>s</i>r al-Bāhilī was evacuated only with the utmost
difficulty. The tale of their relief by a small force of
volunteers is one of the most spirited narratives of
adventure in <i>T</i>abarī. But such episodes did not affect
the general success of the Turkish forces. Kūr<i>s</i>ūl
continued his advance through <i>S</i>ughd without opposition,
avoiding Samarqand, until at last Saʿīd was roused by
public reproach to march against the Turks. After a
small initial success, which he refused to follow up, he
was severely defeated and confined to the neighbourhood
of Samarqand. The Turks were not strong enough to
undertake a siege of the city, as the whole operation
seems to have been little more than a reconnaissance in
force combined with a raiding expedition. As the
Türgesh retired, the Arab cavalry followed them up as
far as Waraghsar, the head of the canal system of <i>S</i>ughd.
Ghūrak appears to have refrained from committing himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
by openly aiding the rebels, and doubtless recognised
that the Arabs were not so easily to be dislodged. From
the fact that Saʿīd’s camp was pitched at Ishtīkhan,
in close proximity to him, it may even be conjectured
that he outwardly supported the Arabs.</p>

<p>But the new governor of ʿIrāq, ʿOmar b. Hubayra,
was not the man to stand idly by in face of the danger
that threatened Khurāsān. The weakness shown by
Khudhayna and the complaints of oppression from his
subjects, were sufficient reason for his recall, and Saʿīd
b. ʿAmr al-<i>H</i>arashī, a man of very different stamp, was
installed in his place. The transfer may be placed in
the late autumn of 103/721. The new governor’s first
act was to summon the rebels to submit, but a large
number of nobles and merchants, with their retainers,
either fearing that they could expect no mercy, or anxious
to free themselves altogether from the Arab yoke, prepared
to emigrate to Farghāna. Ghūrak did his utmost
to persuade them to remain, but without effect; their
absence would no doubt affect the revenues, and a certain
emphasis is laid on the point in <i>T</i>abarī’s account. Leaving
hostages behind, the malcontents marched towards
Farghāna and opened negotiations with the king for the
occupation of ʿI<i>s</i>ām. The majority settled in the interval
at Khujanda, but other parties actually entered Farghāna,
and one body at least occupied a fortified position on the
Zarafshān. Al-<i>H</i>arashī followed up his demands by
marching into <i>S</i>ughd and encamped near Dabūsia,
where he was with difficulty persuaded to stay until
sufficient contingents arrived. On advancing, he was
met by a messenger from the king of Farghāna, who,
outwardly professing to assist the <i>S</i>ughdians, had secretly
decided to rid himself of them by calling in the Arabs
against them. Al-<i>H</i>arashī eagerly seized the opportunity
and pressed forward, receiving the allegiance of
Ushrūsana as he passed. The emigrants, although urged
by their leader Karzanj either to take active measures or
to submit, decided to risk a siege in Khujanda, trusting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
to the protection of the king of Farghāna. But when
Saʿīd set about the siege in earnest, and they realised
that they had been betrayed, they surrendered on
unexpectedly easy terms. Saʿīd divided them, placing
the nobles and merchants in a camp apart from the
soldiers. By the execution of Thābit, a noble from
Ishtīkhan, he provoked a revolt, under pretext of which
he massacred the nobles and the troops, sparing the
merchants, who numbered four hundred, only in order to
squeeze them of their wealth. <i>T</i>abarī’s account very
thinly veils al-<i>H</i>arashī’s responsibility for this wanton
act of atrocious cruelty, which could not fail to embitter
the feelings of the whole population of Transoxania.
It is curious that the Persian <i>T</i>abarī (Zotenberg IV. 268)
has an entirely different story, which is found in none of
the Arabic authorities. The refugees who escaped
eventually took refuge with the Khāqān of the Türgesh,
where they formed a regiment (no doubt continually
recruited from new emigrants) which particularly distinguished
itself in the war against the Arabs<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>.</p>

<p>The expedition to Khujanda may be put in the
spring and summer of 722 (end of 103, beginning of 104),
though the chronology here, and indeed for all this period,
is uncertain. The piecemeal reduction of the fortresses
in <i>S</i>ughd occupied the remainder of the year, a series
of operations whose difficulty is sufficient witness to the
effect of the news from Khujanda in stiffening the
resistance to the Arabs. The first fortress to be attacked
was that of Abghar, in which a band of the emigrants
had settled. The attack was entrusted to Sulaymān
b. Abiʾs-Sarī, with an army composed largely of native
levies from Bukhārā, Khwārizm, and Shūmān, accompanied
by their princes. Sulaymān persuaded the
dihqān to surrender, and sent him to al-<i>H</i>arashī, who at
first treated him well in order to counteract the effect of
the massacre of Khujanda, but put him to death after
recapturing Kish and Rabinjān. The most inaccessible
fortress and the crowning example of Al-<i>H</i>arashī’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
perfidy were left to the last. The dihqān Subuqrī
still held out in the fortress of Khuzar, to the south of
Nasaf; unable to take it by force, Al-<i>H</i>arashī sent
Musarbal b. Al-Khirrīt, a personal friend of Subuqrī,
to offer him a pardon. On his surrender, he was sent to
Merv and put to death, although the amnesty, it is said,
had been confirmed by ʿOmar b. Hubayra.</p>

<p>The whole of <i>S</i>ughd was thus once more in the hands
of the Arabs. The nearer districts, Khwārizm and Bukhārā,
had remained loyal and the Oxus basin seems to have
been unaffected. But to make a solitude and call it
peace did not suit the aims of the Arab government
and Al-<i>H</i>arashī found that his “policy of thorough”
only provided Ibn Hubayra with an excuse for superseding
him. During the winter, therefore, he was replaced
by Muslim b. Saʿīd al-Kilābī, who, as the grandson
of Aslam b. Zurʿa, came of a house long familiar with
Khurāsān. The danger of the movement of revolt
spreading to the Iranians of Khurāsān seems to have preoccupied
the Arab government during all this period.
Saʿīd Khudhayna had poisoned the too-influential
<i>H</i>ayyān an-Naba<i>t</i>ī on suspicion of rousing the Persians
against the government and that it was felt even in Ba<i>s</i>ra
may be seen from Ibn Hubayra’s advice to his new
governor, “Let your chamberlain be one who can make
peace with your mawālī.” Muslim, in fact, favoured
the Persians and did all in his power to appoint officials
acceptable to them, the Mazdean Bahrām Sīs, for example,
being appointed Marzubān of Merv<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>. But all such
measures were merely palliatives and could not materially
affect the growing discontent in <i>S</i>ughd and <i>T</i>ukhāristān.
During his first year of office it is recorded
(if the narrative is not, as Wellhausen thinks, a duplicate
of the raid on Farghāna in the following year) that
Muslim marched across the river but was met and pushed
back into Khurāsān by a Turkish army, narrowly
escaping disaster. It is not improbable that the local
forces were again assisted by Türgesh on this occasion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
In the following year, however, before the close of 105,
a second expedition gained some success at Afshīna,
near Samarqand. Meanwhile Hishām had succeeded
Yazīd II as Caliph, and ʿOmar b. Hubayra, whose Qaysite
leanings were too pronounced, was recalled in favour
of Khālid b. ʿAbdullah al-Qasrī of Bajīla. The transfer
took place most probably in March (724), though
another account places it some months later. Muslim
was now preparing an expedition into Farghāna, but the
Yemenite troops at Balkh held back partly through
dislike of the campaign and doubtless expecting the
governor’s recall. Na<i>s</i>r b. Sayyār was sent with a
Mu<i>d</i>arite force to use compulsion; the mutinous
Yemenites were defeated at Barūqān and unwillingly
joined the army. It is noteworthy that troops from
Chaghāniān fought alongside Na<i>s</i>r in this engagement.
Before leaving Bukhārā Muslim learned that he was to be
superseded, at the same time receiving orders to continue
his expedition. Four thousand Azdites, however, took
the opportunity of withdrawing. The remainder,
accompanied by <i>S</i>ughdian levies, marched into Farghāna,
crossed the Jaxartes, and besieged the capital, cutting
down the fruit trees and devastating the land. Here
news was brought that Khāqān was advancing against
them, and Muslim hurriedly ordered a retreat. The
Arabic accounts graphically describe the headlong flight
of the Arabs. On the first day they retired three stages,
the next day they crossed the Wādī Sabū<i>h</i>, closely pursued
by the Türgesh; a detachment, largely composed of
mawālī, which encamped separately, was attacked and
suffered heavy losses, the brother of Ghūrak being
amongst the killed. After a further eight days’ march,
continually harassed by the light Turkish horse, they
were reduced to burning all the baggage, to the value of a
million dirhems. On reaching the Jaxartes the following
day, they found the way barred by the forces of Shāsh
and Farghāna, together with the <i>S</i>ughdians who had
escaped from Saʿīd al-<i>H</i>arashī, but the desperate and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
thirsty troops, hemmed in by the Türgesh from behind,
cut their way through. The rearguard made a stand,
but lost its commander. At length the remnants of the
army reached Khujanda, where ʿAbdur-Ra<i>h</i>mān b.
Nuʿaym took command on behalf of Asad b. ʿAbdullah,
and made good his retreat to Samarqand.</p>

<p>This disaster, which is known as the “Day of Thirst,”
marks a period in the history of the Arab conquests. It
was practically the last aggressive expedition of the Arabs
into Transoxania for fifteen years, but of much greater
importance was the blow which it struck at Arab prestige.
The rôles were reversed; from now onwards the Arabs
found themselves on the defensive and were gradually
ousted from almost every district across the Oxus. No
wonder, therefore, that the memory of the “Day of
Thirst” rankled even long after it had been avenged<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>.
According to the Arab tradition, the Türgesh armies
were led on this occasion not by Su-Lu himself, but by
one of his sons. Unfortunately the accounts of Su-Lu
in such Chinese works as have been translated are silent
on his Western expeditions, and the Arab historians
are our only authorities. The immediate result of the
Arab defeat, not only in <i>S</i>ughd but in <i>T</i>ukhāristān and
the southern basin as well, was to stiffen the attitude of
passive resistance to the Arabs to the point at which it
only needed active support to break into a general
conflagration. From this time, if not before, the subject
princes regarded the Türgesh as the agents of their
deliverance, commissioned by China in response to the
urgent entreaties they had addressed to the Emperor
for aid in their struggle. We find this actually expressed
in a letter sent three years later by the Jabghu of <i>T</i>ukhāristān,
which is, in Chavannes’ words “but one long
cry of distress”<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>. “I am loaded with heavy taxation
by the Arabs; in truth, their oppression and our misery
are extreme. If I do not obtain the help of the (Chinese)
Kagan ... my kingdom will certainly be destroyed
and dismembered.... I have been told that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
Celestial Kagan has given this order to the Kagan of the
Türgesh: To you I delegate the affairs of the Far West;
you must at once send soldiers to drive out the Arabs.”
The point of view here expressed is of course that of the
ruling princes, whose resentment at the curtailment of
their authority is understandable. Besides making
allowance for some natural exaggeration, it would be
dangerous to assume that this was as yet fully shared by
the people. In all probability, if we may judge from
historical analogies, there was also a pro-Arab party in
Sogdiana, who felt that the best interests of the country
lay, not in an opposition whose final issue could scarcely
be in doubt, but in co-operation with their new masters
as far as was possible. The tragedy of the Arab administration
was that by alternately giving and refusing co-operation
on its side, it drove its supporters in the end to
make common cause with its opponents.</p>

<p>But though the situation was steadily deteriorating
the decisive moment had not yet come. The new governor,
Asad b. ʿAbdullah, seems to have seen something of
the danger though factional feeling was running so high
that the administration was almost helpless in face of it.
He tried to continue Muslim’s policy of conciliation by
appointing agents of known probity. Tawba b. Abī
Usayd, a mawlā who had been intendant for Muslim, and
who “treated the people fairly, made himself easily
accessible, dealt uprightly with the army and maintained
their supplies,” he persuaded to remain in office under him.
Hāniʾ b. Hāniʾ, the financial intendant at Samarqand,
was unpopular; he was recalled and Al-<i>H</i>asan b. Abiʾl-ʿAmarra<i>t</i>a
of Kinda, who was in sympathy with the
mawālī, appointed in his place. With him was associated
Thābit Qu<i>t</i>na, who had been a leader of some repute
under Saʿīd Khudhayna, “gallant warrior, distinguished
poet, confidant of Yazīd b. Muhallab, and
universally popular”<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>. Still more significant is the
fact that one of Asad’s earliest actions was to renew the
practice, neglected since the days of ʿOmar II, of sending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
an embassy to the Chinese court. As before, however,
the Arabs resented the favour shown to the Persians,
and the military weakness of Ibn Abiʾl-ʿAmarra<i>t</i>a roused
them to open anger. Strong Turkish forces, probably
guerilla bands swollen by refugees and malcontents from
the wasted districts, spread over the country and appeared
even before Samarqand. The governor made some show
of opposition, but avoided coming to grips with them,
thus intensifying his unpopularity.</p>

<p>Samarqand indeed was gradually becoming more and
more isolated, but no assistance could be given from
Khurāsān. During his three years of office Asad’s
attention was wholly engaged with the situation in
<i>T</i>ukhāristān and the South. Even here his constant
expeditions, to Gharjistān, Khuttal, and elsewhere, met
with no success. Worse still, in 108/726 he found his
forces in Khuttal opposed by the Khāqān with his
Türgesh. The princes of <i>T</i>ukhāristān had taken to
heart the lessons of the “Day of Thirst”, and the powerful
chief who had already all but driven the Arabs out of
Sogdiana was now called in to expel them from the
Oxus basin as well. Asad visited his failure on the
Mu<i>d</i>arites, whom he may have suspected of treachery,
but the indignation called out by his treatment of such
men as Na<i>s</i>r b. Sayyār, ʿAbdur-Ra<i>h</i>mān b. Nuʿaym,
Sawra b. Al-<i>H</i>urr, and Al-Bakhtarī, made his recall
inevitable. Nor had his measures removed the distrust
and hatred of the subject peoples. The land was wasted
and desolate<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>, the crushing taxation was not lightened,
and all Persian governors were not of the stamp of Tawba;
many of them were but too ready to rival their Arab
rulers in greed and cruelty. Asad may have gained the
friendship of many dihqāns<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>, but that was an easier
matter than to placate the population. In such an
atmosphere it was only to be expected that Shīʿite and
ʿAbbāsid propaganda, though actively combated by the
administration, found a fertile field among the Muslim
converts in Khurāsān and Lower <i>T</i>ukhāristān, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
already beginning to undermine the whole fabric of Arab
government.</p>

<p>For a moment the hopes of a radical change of policy
entertained by the mawālī and the clearer-sighted Arabs
were raised to the highest pitch by the appointment (in 109)
of Ashras b. ʿAbdullah as-Sulami, accompanied by the
separation of Khurāsān from Khālid al-Qasrī’s province
of ʿIrāq. It is unnecessary to recapitulate here the far-reaching
concessions by which he hoped to secure, and
actually did for a time secure the allegiance of the
<i>S</i>ughdians, or the methods by which the local princes,
especially Ghūrak, succeeded in checking the movement<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>.
It is generally assumed that the hostility of Ghūrak
was due to the serious fall in revenue which would result.
Though this was doubtless the plea put forward and
accepted by Ashras it can scarcely have been the true
issue. Ghūrak’s aim was not to maintain himself on good
terms with the Arab governors but to recover his
independence. If once the people became “Arabs”
all hope of success must have been lost. It was a game
with high stakes and Ghūrak won. It must not be overlooked,
however, that the account as we have it is
traditional and may often be mistaken on the sequence
of cause and effect. The astonishing reversal of the
measures adopted by Ashras is more probably to be
explained by pressure from above, not from below, and
our tradition may really present only the popular view of
the Caliph Hishām’s reorganization of the financial administration<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>.
The Arabs resorted to brutal methods to
wring the taxes from the new converts, and with
incredible blindness selected the dihqāns for special
indignities. It is not unlikely that Narshakhī’s story
of the martyrdom of native Muslims in Bukhārā is connected
with this event, though there are many other
possible explanations, such as, for example, an attempted
<i>H</i>ārithite movement (see below, <a href="#Page_76">p. 76 f.</a>) The reaction
swung the whole population of Transoxania, dihqāns
and peasantry alike, into open rebellion. The first small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
party of emigrants who quitted Samarqand, although
supported by a few Arabs, were induced to surrender and
return<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>, but within a few months the dreaded Khāqān
with his Türgesh had joined forces with the rebels and
swept the Arabs across the Oxus. Even Bukhārā was
lost<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> and only Samarqand with two minor posts
on the Zarafshān, Kamarja and Dabūsia, held out.
Ghūrak, however, still supported the Arabs, as
Samarqand, although besieged, seems to have been in
no danger, while his son Mukhtār, doubtless to keep a
footing in the opposite camp, joined with the Türgesh.</p>

<p>The pressing danger sobered the Arabs and temporarily
united all parties and factions. The army was
concentrated at Āmul but for three months was unable to
cross the river in the face of the combined native and
Türgesh armies. A small body under Qa<i>t</i>an b. Qutayba
which had already crossed and fortified itself before the
arrival of the Turks was beleaguered. The Turkish
cavalry even made raids on Khurāsān with an excess of
boldness which was punished by a mounted force under
Thābit Qu<i>t</i>na. At length Ashras got his forces across
and, joining with Qa<i>t</i>an b. Qutayba, advanced on
Paykand. The enemy cut off the water supply, and had
it not been for the gallantry and self-sacrifice of <i>H</i>ārith
b. Surayj, Thābit Qu<i>t</i>na, and their companions, an even
greater and more irretrievable “Day of Thirst” had
resulted. In spite of their weakness, Qa<i>t</i>an and the
cavalry of Qays and Tamīm charged the enemy and forced
them back, so that Ashras was able to continue his
advance towards Bukhārā. In the heavy fighting the
Muslim forces were divided, Ashras and Qa<i>t</i>an gave each
other up for lost, and Ghūrak judged that the time had
come to throw in his lot with the Turks. Two days later,
however, the armies were reunited and on the retiral of
the Turks encamped at Bawādara outside the walls of
Bukhārā, whence they prepared to besiege the city.
Ghūrak also retrieved his error and rejoined Ashras.
The Khāqān withdrew towards Samarqand, but sat down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
before Kamarja, expecting to take it by storm in a few
days at the most. The Arabic narratives of these events
are confused in several places, which has given rise to
many incorrect statements, such as that Ghūrak was
beleaguered with the Arabs in Kamarja and that the
garrison consisted of Qa<i>t</i>an and his forces. Kamarja was
not in the neighbourhood of Paykand, as Wellhausen
states, but a few farsakhs west of Samarqand<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>. When
the garrison would not yield to assault Khāqān tried
other methods. Accompanying his expedition was
Khusrū the son of Pērōz and grandson of Yazdigird,
heir of the Sāsānid kings. This prince was sent to parley
with the garrison, but when he claimed the restoration
of his kingdom and promised them an amnesty, it is not
surprising that the Arabs indignantly refused to hear him.
Nor would the appearance of a Sāsānid prince evoke
much enthusiasm amongst the Iranians of Transoxania.
As the Sāsānid house had taken refuge in China, however,
the presence of Khusrū might be taken as an indication
that the rebels were receiving encouragement from China
also, though the Chinese records are silent on this
expedition. Khāqān’s second proposal, that he should
hire the Arabs as mercenaries, was rejected as derisively
as the first. The siege was then pressed with renewed
vigour, both sides putting their prisoners and hostages
to death, but after fifty-eight days Khāqān, on the advice
of the son of Ghūrak and the other <i>S</i>ughdian princes,
allowed the garrison to transfer either to Samarqand or
Dabūsia. On their choosing the latter, the terms were
faithfully carried out after an exchange of hostages.</p>

<p>The fame of the defence of Kamarja spread far and
wide, but it brought little relief to the pressure on the
Arabs in Transoxania. Even Khwārizm was affected
by the movement of revolt, but at the first symptoms of
open rebellion it was crushed by the local Muslims,
probably Arabs settled in the district, with the aid of a
small force despatched by Ashras. The reference made in
<i>T</i>abarī to assistance given to the rebels by the Turks is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
probably to be discounted, as is done by Ibn al-Athīr.
It is of course quite possible that the movement was
instigated by the Türgesh, though no such explanation
is necessary, but if any Turks were engaged they were
probably local nomadic tribes. Ashras seems to have
remained before Bukhārā during the winter, possibly
in Paykand; the Türgesh probably withdrew towards
Shāsh and Farghāna.</p>

<p>In the following year, 730/111-112<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>, the attacks on
the army of Ashras were renewed. The course of events
can only be gathered from the accounts given of the
difficulties experienced by the new governor, Junayd
b. ʿAbdur-Ra<i>h</i>mān al-Murrī, in joining the army before
Bukhārā. His guide advised him to levy a force from
Zamm and the neighbouring districts before crossing the
Oxus but Junayd refused, only to find himself after crossing
put to the necessity of calling on Ashras for a bodyguard
of cavalry. This force narrowly escaped disaster
on its way to meet Junayd and fought a second severe
engagement on the return journey before reaching
Paykand. The enemy are variously described as “men
of Bukhārā and <i>S</i>ughd” and “Turks and <i>S</i>ughdians”;
it may therefore be assumed that they were the same
forces against whom Ashras had fought the previous
year. Wellhausen is probably correct in supposing that
Ashras was practically beleaguered, though not in
Bukhārā. The recapture of this city and the retiral of
Khāqān took place shortly after Junayd’s arrival, in
circumstances which are not described<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>. The
attitude of Tugshāda during this episode is not recorded.
It is practically certain, however, that he remained in
Bukhārā, and after the reconquest was able to make his
peace with the Arabs, probably on the excuse of <i>force
majeure</i>. At all events he retained his position, possibly
because Junayd thought it impolitic in the face of the
situation to victimise the nobles in the reconquered
territories and thus provoke a more stubborn resistance
in the rest of the country. The Arabs seem to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
followed up the Turks towards Samarqand, probably to
relieve the garrison; the two armies met again at
Zarmān, seven farsakhs from Samarqand, where the
Arabs claimed a success, one of their prisoners being a
nephew of Khāqān. From <i>S</i>ughd the army marched
to Tirmidh where Junayd halted for two months in the
friendly atmosphere of Chaghāniān before returning to
Merv. His intention was no doubt to make arrangements
for the pacification or reconquest of <i>T</i>ukhāristān and
Khuttal; in the following year his troops were actually
engaged in this direction when the Türgesh invasion of
<i>S</i>ughd forced him to change his plans. Balādhurī
quotes Abū ʿUbayda for the statement that Junayd
reconquered certain districts in <i>T</i>ukhāristān which had
revolted.</p>

<p>How lightly even yet factional feeling was slumbering
was shown after the return of the army, when the
Bāhilites of Balkh had a chance to retaliate on Na<i>s</i>r b.
Sayyār for their discomfiture at Barūqān. Though
Junayd was prompt to punish the offending governor,
the incident throws a strong light on one cause of the
weakness of the Arabs in these campaigns.</p>

<p>Early in 731/112-113, the Türgesh and <i>S</i>ughdians
gathered their forces for the investment of Samarqand.
Ghūrak now openly joined the Khāqān. Sawra b.
Al-<i>H</i>urr, the governor of Samarqand, unable to face the
enemy in the field, sent an urgent message to Junayd for
assistance. The governor hastily recalled his troops,
but crossed the river without waiting for them against
the advice of his generals. “No governor of Khurāsān,”
said al-Mujashshar b. Muzā<i>h</i>im, one of the ablest of the
Arab commanders, “should cross the river with less than
fifty thousand men.” Accompanied only by a small
force, Junayd reached Kish, where he raised some local
levies and prepared to march on Samarqand. The enemy
in the meantime, after blocking up the water supplies
on his road, interposed their forces between Samarqand
and the army of relief. Junayd thereupon decided to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
follow the direct route across the Shāwdār mountains
in the hope of avoiding an engagement, but when only
four farsakhs from Samarqand was surprised in the
defiles by Khāqān. The advance-guard was driven in
and the main body engaged in a furious struggle in which
both sides fought to a standstill. The Arabs, hemmed in
on all sides, were forced to entrench; stragglers, refugees,
and baggage, collected near Kish, were attacked by a
detachment of Turks and severely handled. Khāqān
renewed his attacks on the camp the next day, all but
overwhelming Junayd, and settled down thereafter to
beleaguer him. In this predicament there was only one
course open to Junayd. Had his force perished, Samarqand
would certainly have fallen in the end and two
disasters taken the place of one. He therefore adopted
the more prudent, if unheroic, course of ordering Sawra
to leave a skeleton garrison in Samarqand and march out
to join him by way of the river: Sawra, however, took
the short cut across the mountains, and was actually
within four miles of Junayd, when the Turkish forces
bore down on him. The battle lasted into the heat of
the day, when the Turks, on Ghūrak’s advice it is said,
having first set the grass on fire, drew up so as to shut
Sawra off from the water. Maddened by heat and thirst,
the Arabs charged the enemy and broke their ranks,
only to perish miserably in the fire, Turks and Muslims
together. The scattered remnants were pursued by the
Turkish cavalry and of twelve thousand men scarcely
a thousand escaped. While the enemy were engaged with
Sawra, Junayd freed himself from his perilous position
in the defiles, though not without severe fighting, and
completed his march to Samarqand. <i>T</i>abarī gives also
a variant account of the “Battle of the Pass,” the main
difference in which is the inclusion of the Jabghu on the
side of the Turks. In view of the Arab expeditions into
<i>T</i>ukhāristān, it is improbable that the Jabghu, even if
he was present personally, which is doubtful, was
accompanied by any of his troops. The Persian <i>T</i>abarī<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
also contains an entirely different version of the Battle
of the Pass and the fate of Sawra. The original version
is amply attested by contemporary poets, who show no
mercy to Junayd. Whatever credit the Arabs gained in
this battle is reflected on Na<i>s</i>r b. Sayyār and the mawālī.
Junayd remained at Samarqand for some time, recuperating
his forces, while couriers were sent to Hishām with the
news of the disaster. The Caliph immediately ordered
twenty thousand reinforcements from Ba<i>s</i>ra and Kūfa
to be sent to Khurāsān, together with a large number of
weapons and a draft on the treasury, at the same time
giving Junayd a free hand in enlistment.</p>

<p>The Turks, disappointed in their attack on Samarqand,
withdrew to Bukhārā, where they laid siege to Qa<i>t</i>an b.
Qutayba. Here they were also on the natural lines of
communication between Samarqand and Khurāsān.
Junayd held a council, and of three alternatives, either
to remain in Samarqand and await reinforcements, or
to retire on Khurāsān <i>via</i> Kish and Zamm, or to attack
the enemy, chose the last. But the morale of the Arabs
was sadly shaken; a garrison of eight hundred men for
Samarqand was scraped together only by granting a
considerable increase in their pay, while the troops
openly regarded the decision to face Khāqān and the
Turkish hordes as equivalent to courting destruction.
Junayd now marched with the utmost circumspection,
however, and easily defeated a small body of the enemy
in a skirmish near Karmīnīa. The following day
Khāqān attacked his rearguard near <i>T</i>awāwīs (on the
edge of the oasis of Bukhārā), but the attack had been
foreseen and was beaten off. As it was now well into
November, the Türgesh were compelled to withdraw
from Sogdiana, while Junayd entered Bukhārā in
triumph on the festival of Mihrjān. In Chaghāniān he
was joined by the reinforcements, whom he sent on to
Samarqand, the remainder of the troops returning to
their winter quarters.</p>

<p>Junayd seems to have been content with saving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
Samarqand and Bukhārā. As no further expeditions
are recorded of his two remaining years of office it must
be assumed that the situation in <i>S</i>ughd remained unchanged
and that the Türgesh irruptions also were
suspended. Though the Arabs still held Samarqand
and the territories of Bukhārā and Kish, they were in all
probability confined to these, while in the southern basin
their authority hardly extended beyond Balkh and Chaghāniān.
Both sides may have awaited the first move
by the other, but were surprised by the appearance of a
new factor, which threatened the existence of Arab
sovereignty in the Far East more seriously than any
external danger. It is noteworthy that in his last year
of office (115/733) Junayd resumed relations with the
Chinese court. The Turkish title of the leader of the
embassy, Mo-se-lan Tarkan, suggests that none of the
ambassadors were actually Arabs, but that the governor
had commissioned some dignitaries from the subject
states to represent the Arab government. The only
embassy recorded in this year from a native state, however,
came from Khuttal. In the same year Khurāsān
was visited by a severe drought and famine, and to provide
for the needs of Merv, Junayd commandeered supplies
from all the surrounding districts. This, added to the
military disasters of the last few years and the
insinuations of Shīʿite propaganda, provoked open
discontent in the district which had hitherto been outwardly
faithful to Merv, namely the principalities of
Lower <i>T</i>ukhāristān. The leader of the malcontents was
Al-<i>H</i>ārith b. Surayj, who was flogged in consequence
by the governor of Balkh. The discontent flared into
open revolt on the death of Junayd in Mu<i>h</i>arram 716
(Feb. 734). <i>H</i>ārith, assisted by the princes and people
of Jūzjān, Fāryāb, and <i>T</i>ālaqān, marched on Balkh and
captured it from Na<i>s</i>r b. Sayyār. The versions leave
it uncertain whether <i>H</i>ārith defeated Na<i>s</i>r and
then captured the city or whether he entered the city
first and beat off an attempt at recapture by Na<i>s</i>r.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
(Wellhausen’s reference to the Oxus is due to his so misunderstanding
the “river of Balkh” in <i>T</i>ab. 1560. 2.
That it refers here, as frequently, to the Dehas river is
clear from the distance to the city (2 farsakhs, whereas
the Oxus lay twelve farsakhs from Balkh) as well as from
the mention of the bridge of ʿA<i>t</i>ā.) From Balkh he moved
against the new governor ʿĀ<i>s</i>im b. ʿAbdullah al-Hilālī,
at Merv, capturing Merv-Rūdh on the way. ʿĀ<i>s</i>im found
a large section of the inhabitants in league with <i>H</i>ārith,
but on his threatening to evacuate Merv and to call for
Syrian troops, the local forces rallied round him. At
the first reverse, the princes of Lower <i>T</i>ukhāristān
deserted <i>H</i>ārith, whose army fell from sixty thousand to
three thousand. He was thus reduced to making terms
with ʿĀsim, but early in the following year renewed his
revolt. ʿĀsim, hearing that Asad b. ʿAbdullah was on
the way as his successor, began to intrigue with <i>H</i>ārith
against him. The plan miscarried, however; <i>H</i>ārith
seized the governor and held him to ransom, so that Asad
on his arrival found the rebels in possession of all Eastern
Khurāsān, and Merv threatened both from the East and
from the South. Sending a force under ʿAbdur Ra<i>h</i>mān
b. Nuʿaym towards Merv Rūdh to keep <i>H</i>ārith’s main
body in check, he marched himself against the rebel
forces at Āmul and Zamm. These took refuge in the
citadel of Zamm, and Asad, having thus checked the
insurgents in this quarter, continued his march on Balkh.
Meanwhile <i>H</i>ārith seems to have retreated before ʿAbdur-Ra<i>h</i>mān
towards Balkh and thence across the Oxus,
where he laid siege to Tirmidh. Lower <i>T</i>ukhāristān
returned to its allegiance; on the other hand <i>H</i>ārith
was now supported not only by the kings of Khuttal
and Nasaf, but also, as appears from later events, by
the Jabghu of <i>T</i>ukhāristān. The government troops were
unable to cross the Oxus in the face of <i>H</i>ārith’s army;
finding, however, that the garrison was well able to defend
itself, they returned to Balkh, while <i>H</i>ārith, after falling
out with the king of Khuttal, seems to have retired into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
<i>T</i>ukhāristān. Here, following the example of Mūsā
b. Khāzim at Tirmidh, he made a safe retreat for himself
in Badakhshān.</p>

<p>The motives of <i>H</i>ārith’s rebellion have been most
variously estimated. In spite of the unctuous sentiments
which he is represented as uttering on all occasions, it
is hard to find in him the “pious Muslim, ascetic and
reformer” whom van Vloten too sharply contrasts with
the government officials<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>. In spite too of the
prominent position given to him in the Arabic chronicles,
it may even be questioned whether he and his small
personal following were not rather the tools than the
leaders of the elements making for the overthrow of the
Umayyad administration in Khurāsān. At all events the
weakness of his hold over his temporary followers is
much more striking than his transient success. Further
evidence of this is given in a most important narrative
prefaced by <i>T</i>abarī to his account of Asad’s expedition
into <i>S</i>ughd. Except for the scantiest notices, the Arabic
historians have nothing to say regarding the effects of
the war in Khurāsān on the situation in Transoxania.
Wellhausen’s conclusion (based apparently on <i>T</i>abarī
1890. 6) that “<i>H</i>ārith first unfurled the black flag in
Transoxania in the last year of Junayd” is scarcely
tenable. There is further no evidence at all for his
assumption that Samarqand had fallen into the hands
of the <i>H</i>ārithites, especially as Bukhārā remained loyal to
the administration. That Asad’s expedition was not,
in fact, directed against <i>H</i>ārith follows in the clearest
possible manner from the narrative referred to (<i>T</i>ab.
1585. 6-16).</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Then Asad marched towards Samarqand by way of Zamm,
and when he reached Zamm, he sent to Al-Haytham ash-Shaybānī,
one of <i>H</i>ārith’s followers, who was in Bādhkar (the citadel of Zamm),
saying “That which you have disowned in your own people is only
their evil ways, but that does not extend to the women ... <i>nor to
the conquest by the unbelievers of such as Samarqand</i>. Now I am on
my way to Samarqand and I take an oath before God that no harm
shall befall you on my initiative, but you shall have friendly and
honourable treatment and pardon, you and those with you....”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
So Al-Haytham came out to join him on the condition of pardon
which he had given him, and Asad pardoned him, and Al-Haytham
marched with him to Samarqand and Asad gave them double pay.”</p>

</div>

<p>The expedition therefore was obviously against unbelievers.
That the whole of <i>S</i>ughd was lost to the Arabs
is clear from the fact that Asad found it necessary to take
provisions for the army with him from Bukhārā. He was
not successful in recapturing the city, however, and
attempted no more than the damming of the canal
sluices at Waraghsar.</p>

<p>The fate of the garrison of Samarqand has thus been
passed over in silence, unless, perhaps, it is hinted at in
Asad’s reference to the capture of Muslim women.
Whether Ghūrak recaptured it with his own troops or
with the aid of the Türgesh, it can scarcely be doubted
that he had taken advantage of the dissensions in
Khurāsān to realise his ambition and at last drive the
Arabs out of his capital. Of all the conquests of Qutayba
beyond the Oxus, Bukhārā, Chaghāniān, and perhaps
Kish alone remained to the Arabs. A confirmatory
detail is the cessation of <i>S</i>ughdian embassies to China
between 731 and 740: now that independence (even if
under Türgesh suzerainty) had been won again, there was
no need to invoke Chinese support. Negative evidence
of the same kind is afforded by the absence of any Arab
embassy during the same period. Had the Arabs been in
possession of <i>S</i>ughd, it is practically certain that Asad,
as he had done before, would have renewed relations with
the Chinese court. Against this view may be set the
statement in <i>T</i>ab. 1613. 5 that Khāqān was preparing an
army to invest Samarqand at the time of his assassination.
This report is, however, from its nature untrustworthy,
and is contradicted by the presence of the king
of <i>S</i>ughd with <i>S</i>ughdian troops in the Türgesh army in
119/737 as well as by Na<i>s</i>r b. Sayyār’s expedition to
Samarqand two years later. <i>S</i>ughd thus enjoyed once
more a brief period of independence. In 737 or 738
Ghūrak died and his kingdom was divided amongst his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
heirs. He was succeeded at Samarqand by his son Tu-ho
(? <i>T</i>arkhūn), formerly prince of Kabudhān. Another
son Me-chuʾo (? Mukhtār) was already king of Māyamurgh,
while the king of Ishtīkhan in 742 was a certain Ko-lo-pu-lo
who may perhaps be identified with Ghūrak’s
brother Afarūn<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>.</p>

<p>The year after the campaigns against <i>H</i>ārith, 118/736,
was devoted by Asad to the re-organisation of his province,
including a measure which, it seems, he had already
projected in his first term of office. This was the
removal of the provincial capital from Merv to Balkh<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>.
Since no other governor of Khurāsān followed
his example we must seek the motive for the innovation
either in the contemporary situation in Khurāsān
and Transoxania or in Asad’s personal views. Explanations
based on the former are not hard to find. Asad,
on taking office, had been faced with a serious situation
both in Lower <i>T</i>ukhāristān and across the river. He
had obviously to establish a strong point <i>d’appui</i>. The
loyalty of the garrison at Merv was not above suspicion
but the garrison at Balkh was composed of Syrian troops,
who could be trusted to the uttermost<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>. Merv was
also less convenient for reaching <i>T</i>ukhāristān, which was
at the moment the main area of operations. More
important still, perhaps, Balkh was the centre from which
all disturbances spread in Eastern Khurāsān, as in the
revolt of Nēzak and the recent attempt of <i>H</i>ārith. As
the holding of Balkh had enabled Qutayba to forestall
Nēzak, it is possible that Asad felt that in Balkh he would
be in a position to check all similar movements at the
beginning. Other considerations may also have disposed
him to take this view. Balkh was the traditional capital
and on it, as we have seen, was focussed the local sentiment
of Eastern Khurāsān. Merv, on the other hand,
had always been the capital of the foreigners, of the
Sāsānians before the Arabs. Asad’s personal friendship
with the dihqāns may have given him some insight into
the moral effect which would follow from the transference<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
of the administration to the centre of the national life.
Still greater would this effect be when the rebuilding was
carried out not by the Arabs themselves but by their own
people under the supervision of the Barmak, the hereditary
priest-ruler of the ancient shrine. Quite apart
from this, however, the rebuilding of Balkh was an event
of the greatest significance, and once restored it soon
equalled, if it did not eclipse, its rival Merv in size and
importance. While the new city was being built, the
army was employed in expeditions into <i>T</i>ukhāristān,
for the most part under the command of Judayʿ al-Karmānī,
who achieved some successes against the followers
of <i>H</i>ārith and even succeeded in capturing their fortress
in Badakhshān. Other raids were undertaken by the
governor himself, but without results of military
importance.</p>

<p>Asad now planned a more ambitious expedition against
Khuttal, partly in retaliation for the assistance given to
<i>H</i>ārith, partly, it may be, to wipe off an old score. The
chronology presents some difficulties at this point.
<i>T</i>abarī relates two expeditions into Khuttal in the same
year 119/737, both from the same source, but that which is
undoubtedly the earlier is dated towards the close of the
year (Rama<i>d</i>ān = September). Wellhausen avoids the
difficulty by referring this expedition to 118, reckoning
back from the appointment of Na<i>s</i>r b. Sayyār, the data
for which are full and unimpeachable. This would seem
the obvious solution were it not that the date given in
the Chinese records for the assassination of Su-Lu,
738<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>, agrees perfectly with <i>T</i>abarī’s dating of the
Battle of Kharīstān in Dec. 737. The presence of Asad
on the second expedition would then hang together with
the “somewhat legendary” narrative of the Mihrjān
feast. There seems reason, therefore, for dating this
expedition in 120/738 and regarding it as having been
despatched by Asad, though not actually accompanied
by him. <i>T</i>abarī fortunately preserves also a short notice
of the situation in Khuttal. The heir of as-Sabal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
whose name is to be read as Al-Hanash, from the Chinese
transcription Lo-kin-tsie<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>, had fled to China, possibly
on account of factional disturbances. On his deathbed
as-Sabal appointed a regent, Ibn As-Sāʿijī, to govern
the country until Al-Hanash could be restored. The
moment was certainly opportune for making an expedition
and Asad at first carried all before him. On his first
appearance, however, Ibn As-Sāʿijī had appealed for aid
to Su-Lu, who was at his capital Nawākath (on the Chu).
The Khāqān, with a small mounted force including the
<i>S</i>ughdian refugees, marched from Sūyāb (near Tokmak,
on the Chu) to Khuttal in seventeen days, only to find
Asad, warned of his approach by the regent, who was
endeavouring to play both sides off against each other,
in precipitate retreat. The baggage train had been
despatched in advance under Ibrāhīm b. ʿĀ<i>s</i>im with a
guard of Arabs and native troops from Chaghāniān but
the main body was overtaken by the Turks as it was
crossing the river and suffered severe losses. Asad,
considering himself safe with the river between his army
and the enemy, encamped and sent orders to Ibrāhīm
to halt and entrench his position. The Turks, however,
were able to effect a crossing; after an unsuccessful
assault on Asad’s camp, they hastened to overtake the
richer prize while the governor’s troops were too worn out
to protect it. By sending a party under cover to fall on
the troops of Chaghāniān from the rear while he himself
attacked in front, the Khāqān forced an entrance into
Ibrāhīm’s camp. Chāghān Khudāh, faithful to the last,
himself fell with the greater part of his forces but the
remainder of the garrison were saved by the timely
arrival of Asad. According to the main account, the
Arabs were allowed to withdraw to Balkh without
further serious fighting. A variant account given by
<i>T</i>abarī relates an unsuccessful assault by the Türgesh on
Asad’s camp on the morning following the “Battle of
the Baggage,” which happened to be the feast of Fi<i>t</i>r
(1st October 737). On the retiral of the Arabs, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Khāqān, instead of returning to his capital with the
honours of the day, remained in <i>T</i>ukhāristān.</p>

<p>Here he was joined by <i>H</i>ārith, who advised him to
undertake a winter raid into Lower <i>T</i>ukhāristān while
the Arab troops were disbanded, undoubtedly in the
expectation that the local princes would again unite
with him against Asad. The governor retained his army
at Balkh until the winter had set in, and in the meantime
the Khāqān summoned forces to join him from <i>S</i>ughd
and the territories subject to <i>T</i>ukhāristān. The enumeration
which <i>T</i>abarī gives of the troops accompanying the
Khāqān on this expedition shows very clearly how completely
Arab rule in Transoxania and the Oxus basin
had been supplanted by that of the Turks. We are told
that besides the Khāqān’s own Turkish troops and
<i>H</i>ārith with his followers there were present the Jabghu,
the king of <i>S</i>ughd, the prince of Usrūshana, and the rulers
of Shāsh and Khuttal. It is fairly certain, of course,
that the list is exaggerated in so far as the actual presence
of the princes is concerned (it is in fact partially contradicted
in other parts of the narrative), but it can
scarcely be doubted that forces from some, if not all, of
these principalities were engaged. On the evening of
the 9th Dhuʾl-<i>H</i>ijja (7th Dec.) news reached Balkh that
the Türgesh with their auxiliaries, numbering some 30,000,
were at Jazza. Asad ordered signal fires to be lit and
with the Syrian garrison of Balkh and what other troops
he could muster from the district marched out against
them. The governor of Khulm sent in a second report
that the Khāqān, having been repulsed in an attack on the
town, had marched on towards Pērōz Nakhshēr, in the
neighbourhood of Balkh. From this point the enemy,
avoiding Balkh, moved on Jūzjān and occupied the
capital<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>. Instead of continuing his advance immediately,
the Khāqān halted here and sent out raiding
parties of cavalry in all directions, an action which put it
beyond doubt that the immediate object of the expedition
was not the capture of Merv but the rousing of Lower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
<i>T</i>ukhāristān against the Arabs. Contrary to <i>H</i>ārith’s
expectations, however, the king of Jūzjān joined with the
Arabs, who marched towards Shubūrqān by way of
Sidra and Kharīstān. From the conflicting narratives
in <i>T</i>abarī, it seems that Asad surprised the Khāqān in
the neighbourhood of Kharīstān (or Sān) at a moment
when his available forces amounted only to 4,000. A
furious struggle ensued, which was decided in favour of
the Arabs by an assault on the Khāqān from the rear,
on the initiative of the king of Jūzjān. It is in connection
with the battle, which he describes as if it were a set
engagement in which the whole of the opposing forces
were engaged, that <i>T</i>abarī gives his list of the combatants.
But as only 4,000 out of the total of 30,000 troops with the
Khāqān were involved, the list is obviously out of place
and the whole narrative shows the marks of rehandling.
The Muslims gained an overwhelming success: the
Khāqān and <i>H</i>ārith, having narrowly escaped capture
in the confusion, were closely followed by Asad as far as
Jazza, when a storm of rain and snow prevented further
pursuit. They were thus able to regain the Jabghu in
<i>T</i>ukhāristān, with happier fortune than the raiding
parties, whose retreat was cut off by the vigilance of Al-Karmānī,
and of whom only a single band of <i>S</i>ughdians
made good their escape.</p>

<p>On this skirmish at Kharīstān, for it was little more,
hung the fate of Arab rule, not only in Transoxania, but
possibly even in Khurāsān, at least for the immediate
future. Though the princes of Lower <i>T</i>ukhāristān
fought for Asad in the first place, there can be little doubt
that a victory for Su-Lu would have swung them back to
the side of <i>H</i>ārith and the Turks, who would then have
been in a position to follow up their attacks with the
advantage of a base at Balkh, solidly supported by the
Oxus provinces. From such a danger the Arabs were
saved only by Asad’s resolution and fortunate selection
of Balkh as his residence. The account given of Hishām’s
incredulity on hearing the report shows how very serious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
the outlook had been and the extent to which the name of
the Khāqān had become an omen of disaster. Kharīstān
was not only the turning point in the fortunes of the Arabs
in Central Asia, but gave the signal for the downfall of
the Türgesh power, which was bound up with the personal
prestige of Su-Lu. The princes of <i>T</i>ukhāristān and
Transoxania found it expedient to treat him with respect
as he was returning to Nawākath, but in his own country
the dissensions long fomented in secret by the Chinese
broke out. Su-Lu was assassinated by the Baga Tarkhan
(Kūr<i>s</i>ūl); the kingdom fell to pieces. “The Turks
split up and began to raid one another,” and the <i>coup de
grâce</i> of the Khanate was delivered at Sūyāb in 739 by
the faction of Kūr<i>s</i>ūl, supported by the Chinese and
with the assistance of Al-Ishkand and contingents from
Shāsh and Farghāna<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a><a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>. With the collapse of the
Türgesh kingdom disappeared the last great Turkish
confederation in Western Asia for more than two
centuries to come. The battle of Kharīstān assured
the supremacy of the Muslim civilisation in Sogdiana, but
it could not have attained the richness of its full development
there unless all danger from the steppes had been
removed. That this security was attained was due not
to the Arabs, but to the Chinese diplomacy, which, by
breaking down the greatest external obstacle to the
Muhammadan penetration of Central Asia, brought itself
face to face with the Arabs. This could scarcely have
been realised at once, however, by the Arab government,
whose immediate task was to restore its lost authority
in Transoxania.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_98" id="Footnote_98"></a><a href="#FNanchor_98"><span class="label">[98]</span></a> The frequent references in the Chinese annals to the association of Se-kin-tʾi,
king of Kish, with the Türgesh raise an interesting problem. There can
be no doubt that he is the same prince as Al-Ishkand, ruler of Nasaf,
in the Arabic records. The name is Iranian and personal, not dynastic.
(See Justi’s Iranisches Namenbuch.) Al-Ishkand is first mentioned in the
account of the Battle of the Pass, (<i>T</i>ab. 1542. 8) where he appears in command
of a cavalry force on the side of the Khāqān, though Kish and
Nasaf were both in the hands of the Arabs (1545. 1). The forces which
he commanded were therefore not the ordinary local troops. During
<i>H</i>ārith’s siege of Tirmidh he received reinforcements from Al-Ishkand,
but no statement is made on the composition of his forces. He is
mentioned again as accompanying the Khāqān and the <i>S</i>ughdians in the
attack on Asad before the “Battle of the Baggage” (1597. 17-18,) where
the reading ‘I<i>s</i>pahbadh of Nasā’ is probably an error in the tradition.
Again there can be no question here of local troops from Nasaf or Kish. In
the Chinese records Se-kin-tʾi appears as the commander of an independent
force, not merely a detachment of Turks or levies from Shāsh or Farghāna.
The most reasonable conclusion is that Al-Ishkand was the commander
of the corps of <i>S</i>ughdian refugees. This would explain the title “King of
the Warriors” by which he is sometimes mentioned in the Chinese records
(Chav. Doc. 147 n. 1 and 313). The actual term (Chākar) from which
the title was derived does not appear in the Arabic histories in this connection,
but it is perhaps possible that a variant of the name (derived
from <i>razm</i>) is to be read in <i>T</i>ab. 1614. 2 for the meaningless “razābin al-Kissī.”
In 1609. 15 a force of “Bābīya” is mentioned along with the
<i>S</i>ughdians, and the name, though unrecognisable, probably refers to some
forces connected with <i>S</i>ughd. Wellhausen’s conclusion that the <i>S</i>ughdians
and “Bābīya” formed part of the personal following of <i>H</i>ārith b.
Surayj seems to force the connection in the text too far (<i>h</i>amala ʾl-<i>h</i>ārithu
waman maʿahu min ahliʾs-sughdi wal-bābīyati). On the other hand,
since al-Ishkand appears as the ally of <i>H</i>ārith, we may conclude that
some understanding existed between the latter and the <i>S</i>ughdians (and
therefore the Turks) at the time of his revolt. It is probable that the
<i>S</i>ughdian corps assisted in the recovery of Samarqand from the Arabs.</p>

<h2 id="V_THE_RECONQUEST_OF_TRANSOXANIA">V. THE RECONQUEST OF TRANSOXANIA.</h2>

<p>The reaction produced by the downfall of the Türgesh
power was manifested in Transoxania in the first place
by an increased regard for China. The princes had found
the Türgesh yoke no less galling in the end than that of
the Arabs<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>; the country was as wasted and impoverished
by their continual raids as it had been under
the latter. The profitable native and transit trade, the
source of the entire wealth of the cities, must have shrunk
to negligible proportions if it had not wholly ceased.
All classes of the people therefore were weary of war and
sought only a peace consonant with their self-respect.
For the attainment of these aims it was vain to look to
China; the granting of bombastic titles to a few princes
brought neither comfort nor aid. A final opportunity
was thus offered to wise statesmanship to swing the whole
country round to the Arabs almost without a blow.
For two years, however, the situation seemed to remain
much as it was, except for an expedition into Khuttal,
probably on the pretext of assisting the ruling house
against a usurper from Bamiyān. Nevertheless some
progress had been made by the administration in regaining
the prestige it had lost. This was due not merely to the
effect of the victories over <i>H</i>ārith and the Türgesh, but
even more to Asad’s personal relations with the dihqāns.
He had, as we have seen, gratified the national pride
of the people of <i>T</i>ukhāristān by transferring the seat of
power from Merv, the capital of the foreigners, to Balkh,
the centre of their national life. As had been the case
even in his first term of office, he was able to attract to
his side many of the more influential elements in Lower
<i>T</i>ukhāristān and the Ephthalite lands—to this, in fact,
was largely due his success in the struggle with the Turks.
More striking evidence still is afforded by the conversion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
of the dihqāns at this period, amongst them the minor
chief Sāmān-Khudāh and probably also the Barmak.
By this means Asad laid the foundations for a true
reconciliation and Narshakhī’s work amply attests the
honour which later generations attached to his name.
His work was of course incomplete in that it was practically
confined to the ruling classes and naturally did not
extend to the now independent dihqāns of <i>S</i>ughd.</p>

<p>Early in 120/738 Asad died, and after a lapse of some
months the governorship was conferred by Hishām on
Na<i>s</i>r b. Sayyār. For the subject peoples no choice
could have been more opportunely made. Na<i>s</i>r was
one of the few men who had come with honour and
reputation through the external and internal conflicts
of the last thirty years. Belonging to the small and
almost neutral tribe of Kināna, his position bore a strong
similarity to that of Qutayba in that both were more
dependent on the support of a powerful patron than on
their tribal connexions, and therefore, though favouring
Qays, less frantically partisan. In contrast to Qutayba,
however, Na<i>s</i>r, after thirty years of active leadership,
knew the situation in Khurāsān, Transoxania,
and Central Asia as no Arab governor had ever done.
He had seen the futility of trying to hold the country
by mere brute force, and the equal futility of trying to
dispense with force. While he held the support of
Hishām, therefore, he set himself to restore Arab authority
in Transoxania. The appointment of Qa<i>t</i>an b. Qutayba,
who had inherited much of his father’s ability, to
command the forces beyond the river gave earnest
of an aggressive policy. The appointment was not to
Samarqand, as Wellhausen says, but “over <i>S</i>ughd,”
<i>i.e.</i>, the garrisons in Bukhārā and probably Kish, who were
responsible in the first place for keeping the surrounding
districts in subjection. The governor himself then carried
out a brief expedition, intended apparently to punish
some rebels in the neighbourhood of the Iron Gate,
possibly in Shūmān. Having thus vindicated the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
authority of the administration, Na<i>s</i>r returned to Merv
and delivered the famous Khu<i>t</i>ba in which the system of
taxation and conditions of amnesty were at last laid down
in a form satisfactory to the mawālī and the subject
peoples<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>. The results were as he had foreseen. The
princes and people of Transoxania submitted, as far as
we can judge, without opposition when Na<i>s</i>r with his army
marched through <i>S</i>ughd to re-establish the Arab garrison
and administration in Samarqand.</p>

<p>This expedition may in all probability be dated in
121/739. A year or two later, Na<i>s</i>r collected his forces,
which included levies from Transoxania, for an attack
on Shāsh. Wellhausen considers that the first two
expeditions were only stages of the third, but the
expedition to Shāsh can hardly have taken place earlier
than 122/740, in view of the fact that the armies of Shāsh
and Farghāna were engaged with the Türgesh in 739,
and of Narshakhī’s statement<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>, which there is no reason
to dispute, that <i>T</i>ughshāda was assassinated in the thirty-second
year of his reign. Reckoning in lunar years this
gives 122 (91-122), in solar years 123 (710-741), as the
date. This is confirmed by the Chinese record of an
embassy from Shāsh in 741 complaining that “Now
that the Turks have become subject to China, it is only
the Arabs that are a curse to the Kingdoms”<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>. 123 is
also the date given for the return of the <i>S</i>ughdians<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>.
It is most unlikely that the intervening year or years
passed without expeditions altogether, and the most
reasonable supposition is that they were occupied in the
pacification of <i>S</i>ughd. The expedition marched eastward
through Ushrūsana, whose prince, as usual, paid
his allegiance to the victor on his passage, but on reaching
the Jaxartes Na<i>s</i>r found his crossing opposed by the army
of Shāsh, together with <i>H</i>ārith b. Surayj and some
Turkish troops. It would seem that he was unable to
come to blows with the main body of the enemy, but
made a treaty with the king by which the latter agreed
to accept an Arab resident and to expel <i>H</i>ārith, who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
accordingly deported to Fārāb. As usual, later tradition
magnified the exploits of the Arabs by crediting Na<i>s</i>r
with the capture and execution of Kūr<i>s</i>ūl, the Türgesh
leader who had been scarcely less redoubtable than the
Khāqān himself. If the story has any foundation it is
probably a legendary development from the capture
of a Turkish chief Al-Akhram, related by <i>T</i>abarī in a
variant account. The presence of Kūr<i>s</i>ūl with a Türgesh
force on this occasion is not in itself impossible, but if his
identification with Baga Tarkhan is sound, we know that
he was executed by the Chinese in 744/126<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>. The
expulsion of <i>H</i>ārith was probably the object for which the
expedition had been undertaken; before returning,
however, the Arabs entered Farghāna and pursued its
king as far as Qubā before bringing him to terms. The
negotiations were carried out between Sulaymān b.
<i>S</i>ūl, one of the princes of Jūrjān, and the Queen-Mother.
This invasion of Farghāna is related in three (or four)
different versions, some of which may possibly refer to a
second expedition mentioned by <i>T</i>abarī later. In the
same year, on returning from the expedition to Shāsh,
Na<i>s</i>r was met at Samarqand by the Bukhār Khudāh
<i>T</i>ughshāda and two of his dihqāns. The nobles laid a
complaint against the prince, but as Na<i>s</i>r seemed indisposed
to redress their grievance, they attempted to
assassinate both the Bukhār Khudāh and the Arab
intendant at Bukhārā, Wā<i>s</i>il b. ʿAmr. The former
was mortally wounded, and succeeded by his son Qutayba,
so named in honour of the conqueror. The incident is
related also by Narshakhī with some additional details
which profess to explain the assassination. The two
narratives present such a remarkable similarity of phrase,
however, even though they are in different languages,
that it is rather more likely that the Persian version has
elaborated the story than that <i>T</i>abarī deliberately
suppressed any offensive statements, as argued by van
Vloten<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>.</p>

<p>Except for a possible second expedition to Farghāna,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
no other campaigns into Transoxania are recorded of
Na<i>s</i>r, unless Balādhurī’s tradition (from Abū ʿUbayda)
of an unsuccessful attack on Ushrūsana refers to a
separate expedition. This is unlikely, and the account
conflicts with that given in <i>T</i>abarī. Ushrūsana, however,
was never really subdued until nearly a century later.
<i>T</i>ukhāristān, if it had not already been recovered by
Asad, may have made submission of its own accord.
Since the defeat of the Türgesh and the flight of <i>H</i>ārith
it had ceased to hold any menace to the Arabs, and Na<i>s</i>r
had accordingly retransferred the capital to Merv on his
appointment.</p>

<p>The governor now turned his attention to restoring
the prosperity of the country and developing a policy
of co-operation with the subject peoples. Na<i>s</i>r was the
first Arab ruler of Transoxania to realise that the government
depended for support in the last resort on the
middle classes and agriculturalists. Both these classes
were of greater political importance perhaps in Transoxania,
with its centuries of mercantile tradition, than
any other were in the Empire. It was in the same
way that in later years the <i>T</i>āhirids and Sāmānids
established their ascendancy<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>. He was thus able not
only to complete the work begun by Asad b. ʿAbdullah,
but to settle it on more stable foundations. Shortly
after his recapture of Samarqand he had sent an embassy
to China. This was followed up in 126/744 by a much
more elaborate embassy, obviously intended to regulate
commercial relations in the most complete manner
possible, in which the Arabs were accompanied by
ambassadors not only from the Sogdian cities and
<i>T</i>ukhāristān, but even from Zābulistān, Shāsh, and the
Türgesh. Two other Arab embassies are also recorded
in 745 and 747. There can be no doubt that it was not
so much the justice of Na<i>s</i>r’s rule as his personal influence
and honesty that reconciled the peoples of Transoxania.
Even the <i>S</i>ughdian refugees, stranded after the dissolution
of the Türgesh confederacy, trusted him to honour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
the conditions upon which they had agreed to return,
and were not deceived although his concessions raised
a storm of protest, and the Caliph himself was brought
to confirm them only for the sake of restoring peace.</p>

<p>It is not surprising, however, that the princes were
dissatisfied with the success which had attended the
pacification of Transoxania. The people were “becoming
Arabs” too rapidly and their own authority was
menaced in consequence. They were still hopeful of
regaining their independence, especially when Na<i>s</i>r’s
position became less secure after the death of Hishām.
We hear therefore of sporadic embassies to China, such
as that sent from Ishtīkhan in 745 asking for annexation
to China “like a little circumscription.” That the
governor was aware of this undercurrent may be judged
from the fact that he felt it necessary to have <i>H</i>ārith b.
Surayj pardoned, in case he should again bring in the
Turks to attack the government<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>. But the people as
a whole held for Na<i>s</i>r. The respect and even affection
which he inspired held all Transoxania true to him
during the last troubled years. No tribute could be more
eloquent than the facts that not a single city in Transoxania
took advantage of the revolutionary movements
in Khurāsān to withdraw its allegiance, that Abū Muslim’s
missionaries went no further than the Arab colonies at
Āmul, Bukhārā, and Khwārizm, and that the loyal
garrison of Balkh found first support and then refuge in
Chaghāniān and <i>T</i>ukhāristān. On these facts the
various authorities whose narratives are related by
<i>T</i>abarī completely agree, and by their agreement disprove
the exaggerated account given by Dīnawarī (359 f.) that
“Abū Muslim sent his envoys (duʿāt) to all quarters of
Khurāsān, and the people rallied <i>en masse</i> to Abū Muslim
from Herāt, Būshanj, Merv-Rūdh, <i>T</i>ālaqān, Merv, Nasā,
Abīward, <i>T</i>ūs, Naysābūr, Sarakhs, Balkh, Chaghāniān,
<i>T</i>ukhāristān, Khuttalān, Kish, and Nasaf.” Dīnawarī
himself states a little later that Samarqand joined Abū
Muslim only after the death of Na<i>s</i>r. Abū Muslim’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
main strength, in fact, was drawn from Lower <i>T</i>ukhāristān
and the neighbourhood of Merv-Rūdh, several of the
princes of which, including the ruler of Būshanj and
Khālid b. Barmak, declared for him. But even here the
people were not solidly against the administration.
We are told that a camp was established at Jīranj
(south of Merv) “to cut off the reinforcements of Na<i>s</i>r
b. Sayyār from Merv-Rūdh, Balkh, and the districts of
(Lower) <i>T</i>ukhāristān.” Herāt fell to Abū Muslim
by force of arms. The Syrian garrison of Balkh, together
with the Mu<i>d</i>arite party, were supported by the rulers
of both Upper and Lower <i>T</i>ukhāristān, and twice recaptured
the city from their stronghold at Tirmidh.
An example of Abū Muslim’s efforts to gain over the
Iranians is afforded by an incident when, having taken
300 Khwārizmian prisoners in an engagement, he
treated them well and set them free<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>.</p>

<p>The tradition of the enthusiasm of the Iranians for
Abū Muslim is true only of the period after his success.
In our most authentic records there is no trace of a mass
movement such as has so often been portrayed. His
following was at first comparatively so small that had the
Arabs been more willing to support Na<i>s</i>r at the outset,
it is practically certain that it would have melted away as
rapidly as the following of <i>H</i>ārith b. Surayj at the first
reverse. “Nothing succeeds like success,” and Abū
Muslim, once victorious on so imposing a scale, and that
with the aid of Iranians, became a heroic figure among
the peoples of Eastern Khurāsān. The legend penetrated
but slowly into Transoxania. When by 130/748, however,
the whole of Eastern Khurāsān had fallen to Abū Muslim
and Na<i>s</i>r no longer held authority, his governors in
Transoxania were replaced by the nominees of Abū
Muslim without outward disturbance. But the recrudescence
of embassies to China shows that under the
surface currents were stirring. Shāsh had already
thrown off its allegiance and the Sogdian princes had by
no means lost all hope of regaining independence in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
spite of the tranquillity of the last few years. As it
happened, however, the first revolt was not on their part
but by the Arab garrison of Bukhārā under Sharīk b.
Shaykh in 133/750-751. The rising, which was due to
their resentment at the seizure of the Caliphate by the
ʿAbbāsids and the passing over of the ʿAlid house, was
suppressed with some difficulty by Abū Muslim’s lieutenant
Ziyād b. Sāli<i>h</i> assisted by the Bukhār Khudāh.
The fact that the Bukhār-Khudāh assisted the troops of
Abū Muslim against Sharīk might be regarded as an
indication that he belonged to the party of the former.
This inference is more than doubtful, however. Of the
30,000 men, who, we are told, joined the rebels, probably
the greater part were the townsmen, or “popular party,”
of Bukhārā. The revolt thus assumed the domestic
character of a movement against the aristocratic party,
who, led by the Bukhār-Khudāh, naturally cooperated
with the Government in its suppression. The events
of the following year are sufficient evidence against any
other explanation. According to Narshakhī, who gives
by far the fullest account of this revolt, Ziyād had also
to suppress a similar movement in Samarqand. In
the same year an expedition was sent into Khuttal by
Abū Dāwud, the governor of Balkh. Al-<i>H</i>anash at
first offered no opposition; later in the campaign he
attempted to hold out against the Arabs but was forced to
fly to the Turks and thence to China where he was given
the title of Jabghu in recompense for his resistance<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>.
By this expedition Khuttal was effectively annexed to the
Arab government for the first time.</p>

<p>Of much greater, and indeed decisive, importance were
the results of an expedition under Ziyād b. Sāli<i>h</i> into the
Turkish lands beyond the Jaxartes. It is surprising to
find no reference to this either in <i>T</i>abarī or any other
of the early historians. A short notice is given by Ibn
al-Athīr, drawn from some source which is now apparently
lost. The earliest reference which we find in the Arabic
histories seems to be a passing mention of Ziyād b.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Sāli<i>h</i>’s expedition “into <i>S</i>īn” in a monograph on Baghdād
by Ibn <i>T</i>ayfūr (d. 250/983)<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>. For a detailed
account of the battle we are therefore dependent on the
Chinese sources<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>. In 747 and 749 the Jabghu of
<i>T</i>ukhāristān had appealed to China for aid against
certain petty chiefs who were giving trouble in the Gilghit
and Chitral valleys. The governor of Kucha despatched
on this duty a Corean officer, Kao-hsien-shih, who
punished the offenders in a series of amazing campaigns
over the high passes of the Karakorum. Before returning
to Kucha after the last campaign he was called in by the
King of Farghāna to assist him against the king of
Shāsh. Kao-hsien-shih at first came to terms with the king
of Shāsh but when on some pretext he broke his word and
seized the city, the heir to the kingdom fled to <i>S</i>ughd for
assistance and persuaded Abū Muslim to intervene.
A strong force was accordingly despatched under Ziyād
b. Sāli<i>h</i>. The Chinese, with the army of Farghāna and the
Karluks (who had succeeded the Türgesh in the hegemony
of the Western Turks), gave battle at Athlakh,
near <i>T</i>arāz, in July 751 (Dhuʾl-<i>h</i>ijja 133). During the
engagement the Karluks deserted and Kao-hsien-shih,
caught between them and the Arabs, suffered a crushing
defeat. Though this battle marks the end of Chinese
power in the West, it was in consequence of internal
disruption rather than external pressure. Nothing was
further at first from the minds of the princes of <i>S</i>ughd than
the passing of the long tradition of Chinese sovereignty,
indeed it blazed up more strongly than ever. For had
not a Chinese army actually visited Shāsh on their very
borders; even if the Arabs had won the first battle, would
they not return to avenge the defeat? For the last
time the Shao-wu princes planned a concerted rising in
Bukhārā, Kish, <i>S</i>ughd, and Ushrūsana. But China gave
neither aid nor encouragement; the presence of Abū
Muslim at Samarqand overawed the <i>S</i>ughdians, and only
at Kish did the revolt assume serious proportions. Abū
Dāwud’s army easily crushed the insurgents in a pitched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
battle at Kandak, near Kish, killing the king Al-Ikhrīd
and many of the other dihqāns. Amongst the treasures
of the royal palace which were sent to Samarqand were
“many articles of rare Chinese workmanship, vessels
inlaid with gold, saddles, brocades, and other objects
d’art.” The Bukhār-Khudāh Qutayba and the dihqāns
of <i>S</i>ughd also paid for their complicity with their
lives<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>.</p>

<p>So ended the last attempt at restoring an independent
Sogdiana under the old régime. For some years yet the
princes of <i>S</i>ughd, Khwārizm, and <i>T</i>ukhāristān continued
to send appeals to China. The Emperor, however,
“preoccupied with maintaining peace, praised them all
and gave them consolation, then having warned them sent
them back to assure tranquillity in the Western lands.”
Abū Muslim had also, it would seem, realised the
importance of maintaining relations with the Chinese
court, for a succession of embassies from “the Arabs
with black garments” is reported, beginning in the year
following the battle of the Talas. As many as three are
mentioned in a single year. It is possible that these
embassies were in part intended to keep the government
informed on the progress of the civil wars in China,
though the active interest of the new administration in
their commerce would, as before, tend to reconcile the
influential mercantile communities to ʿAbbāsid rule. The
actual deathblow to the tradition of Chinese overlordship
in Western Central Asia was given, not by any such
isolated incident as the battle of the Talas, but by the
participation of Central Asian contingents in the
restoration of the Emperor to his capital in 757<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>.
Men from the distant lands to whom China had seemed
an immeasurably powerful and unconquerable Empire
now saw with their own eyes the fatal weaknesses that
Chinese diplomacy had so skilfully concealed. From this
blow Chinese prestige never recovered.</p>

<p>The complete shattering of the Western Turkish
empires by the Chinese policy had also put an end to all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
possibility of intervention from that side. Transoxania,
therefore, was unable to look for outside support, while
the reorganization of the Muslim Empire by the early
ʿAbbāsid Caliphs prevented, not indeed sporadic though
sometimes serious risings, but any repetition of the
concerted efforts at national independence. The Shao-wu
princes and the more important dihqāns continued to
exercise a nominal rule until the advent of the Sāmānids,
but many of them found that the new policy of the Empire
offered them an opportunity of honourable and lucrative
service in its behalf and were quick to take advantage of
it. On the other hand the frequent revolts in Eastern
Khurāsān under the guise of religious movements show
that the mass of the people remained unalterably hostile
to their conquerors<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>. In none of these, however, was
the whole of Transoxania involved until the rising
organized by Rāfiʿ b. Layth three years after the fall of
the Barmakids. The extraordinary success of his
movement may partly be ascribed to resentment at their
disgrace, but it perhaps counted for something that he
was the grandson of Na<i>s</i>r b. Sayyār. Though the revolt
failed it led directly to the only solution by which Transoxania
could ever become reconciled to inclusion in the
Empire of the ʿAbbāsids. Whether by wise judgment
or happy chance, to Maʿmūn belongs the credit of laying
the foundations of the brilliant Muhammadan civilisation
which the Iranian peoples of Central Asia were to
enjoy under the rule of a dynasty of their own race.</p>
